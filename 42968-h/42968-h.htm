<h2><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>The present study of the monistic philosophy is
intended for thoughtful readers of every condition
who are united in an honest search for the truth.
An intensification of this effort of man to attain a
knowledge of the truth is one of the most salient
features of the nineteenth century. That is easily explained,
in the first place, by the immense progress
of science, especially in its most important branch,
the history of humanity; it is due, in the second place,
to the open contradiction that has developed during
the century between science and the traditional &ldquo;Revelation&rdquo;;
and, finally, it arises from the inevitable extension
and deepening of the rational demand for an
elucidation of the innumerable facts that have been
recently brought to light, and for a fuller knowledge
of their causes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this vast progress of empirical knowledge
in our &ldquo;Century of Science&rdquo; has not been accompanied
by a corresponding advancement of its
theoretical interpretation&mdash;that higher knowledge of
the causal nexus of individual phenomena which we
call philosophy. We find, on the contrary, that the
abstract and almost wholly metaphysical science
which has been taught in our universities for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
last hundred years under the name of &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo;
is far from assimilating our hard-earned treasures of
experimental research. On the other hand, we have
to admit, with equal regret, that most of the representatives
of what is called &ldquo;exact science&rdquo; are content
with the special care of their own narrow branches
of observation and experiment, and deem superfluous
the deeper study of the universal connection of the
phenomena they observe&mdash;that is, philosophy. While
these pure empiricists &ldquo;do not see the wood for the
trees,&rdquo; the metaphysicians, on the other hand, are satisfied
with the mere picture of the wood, and trouble not
about its individual trees. The idea of a &ldquo;philosophy
of nature,&rdquo; to which both those methods of research,
the empirical and the speculative, naturally converge,
is even yet contemptuously rejected by large numbers
of representatives of both tendencies.</p>

<p>This unnatural and fatal opposition between science
and philosophy, between the results of experience and
of thought, is undoubtedly becoming more and more
onerous and painful to thoughtful people. That is
easily proved by the increasing spread of the immense
popular literature of &ldquo;natural philosophy&rdquo; which has
sprung up in the course of the last half-century. It is
seen, too, in the welcome fact that, in spite of the
mutual aversion of the scientific observer and the
speculative philosopher, nevertheless eminent thinkers
from both camps league themselves in a united effort
to attain the solution of that highest object of inquiry
which we briefly denominate the &ldquo;world-riddles.&rdquo;
The studies of these &ldquo;world-riddles&rdquo; which I offer
in the present work cannot reasonably claim to give
a perfect solution of them; they merely offer to a
wide circle of readers a critical inquiry into the prob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>lem,
and seek to answer the question as to how nearly
we have approached that solution at the present day.
What stage in the attainment of truth have we actually
arrived at in this closing year of the nineteenth century?
What progress have we really made during its
course towards that immeasurably distant goal?</p>

<p>The answer which I give to these great questions
must, naturally, be merely subjective and only partly
correct; for my knowledge of nature and my ability
to interpret its objective reality are limited, as are
those of every man. The one point that I can claim
for it, and which, indeed, I must ask of my strongest
opponents, is that my Monistic Philosophy is sincere
from beginning to end&mdash;it is the complete expression
of the conviction that has come to me, after many
years of ardent research into Nature and unceasing
reflection, as to the true basis of its phenomena. For
fully half a century has my mind&rsquo;s work proceeded,
and I now, in my sixty-sixth year, may venture to
claim that it is mature; I am fully convinced that this
&ldquo;ripe fruit&rdquo; of the tree of knowledge will receive no
important addition and suffer no substantial modification
during the brief spell of life that remains to me.</p>

<p>I presented all the essential and distinctive elements
of my monistic and genetic philosophy thirty-three
years ago, in my <i>General Morphology of Organisms</i>, a
large and laborious work, which has had but a limited
circulation. It was the first attempt to apply in detail
the newly established theory of evolution to the whole
science of organic forms. In order to secure the acceptance
of at least one part of the new thought which it
contained, and to kindle a wider interest in the greatest
advancement of knowledge that our century has witnessed,
I published my <i>Natural History of Creation</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
two years afterwards. As this less complicated work,
in spite of its great defects, ran into nine large editions
and twelve different translations, it has contributed
not a little to the spread of monistic views. The same
may be said of the less known <i>Anthropogeny</i><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (1874),
in which I set myself the difficult task of rendering the
most important facts of the theory of man&rsquo;s descent
accessible and intelligible to the general reader; the
fourth, enlarged, edition of that work appeared in
1891. In the paper which I read at the fourth International
Congress of Zoology at Cambridge, in 1898,
on &ldquo;Our Present Knowledge of the Descent of Man&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
(a seventh edition of which appeared in 1899), I treated
certain significant and particularly valuable advances
which this important branch of anthropology has recently
made. Other isolated questions of our modern
natural philosophy, which are peculiarly interesting,
have been dealt with in my <i>Collected Popular Lectures
on the Subject of Evolution</i> (1878). Finally, I have
briefly presented the broad principles of my monistic
philosophy and its relation to the dominant faith in
my <i>Confession of Faith of a Man of Science: Monism
as a Connecting Link between Religion and Science</i><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
(1892, eighth edition, 1899).</p>

<p>The present work on <i>The Riddle of the Universe</i>
is the continuation, confirmation, and integration of
the views which I have urged for a generation in the
aforesaid volumes. It marks the close of my studies
on the monistic conception of the universe. The earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
plan, which I projected many years ago, of constructing
a complete &ldquo;System of Monistic Philosophy&rdquo; on
the basis of evolution will never be carried into effect
now. My strength is no longer equal to the task,
and many warnings of approaching age urge me to
desist. Indeed, I am wholly a child of the nineteenth
century, and with its close I draw the line under my
life&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>The vast extension of human knowledge which has
taken place during the present century, owing to a
happy division of labor, makes it impossible to-day
to range over all its branches with equal thoroughness,
and to show their essential unity and connection.
Even a genius of the highest type, having an
equal command of every branch of science, and largely
endowed with the artistic faculty of comprehensive
presentation, would be incapable of setting forth a
complete view of the cosmos in the space of a moderate
volume. My own command of the various branches of
science is uneven and defective, so that I can attempt
no more than to sketch the general plan of such a
world-picture, and point out the pervading unity of its
parts, however imperfect be the execution. Thus it
is that this work on the world-enigma has something
of the character of a sketch-book, in which studies of
unequal value are associated. As the material of the
book was partly written many years ago, and partly
produced for the first time during the last few years,
the composition is, unfortunately, uneven at times;
repetitions, too, have proved unavoidable. I trust those
defects will be overlooked.</p>

<p>In taking leave of my readers, I venture the hope
that, through my sincere and conscientious work&mdash;in
spite of its faults, of which I am not unconscious&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>I
have contributed a little towards the solution of the
great enigma. Amid the clash of theories, I trust
that I have indicated to many a reader who is absorbed
in the zealous pursuit of purely rational knowledge
that path which, it is my firm conviction, alone leads
to the truth&mdash;the path of empirical investigation and
of the Monistic Philosophy which is based upon it.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>The hour is close upon us when we shall commence
our retrospect of one of the most wonderful sections
of time that was ever measured by the sweep
of the earth. Already the expert is at work, dissecting
out and studying his particular phase of that vast
world of thought and action we call the nineteenth
century. Art, literature, commerce, industry, politics,
ethics&mdash;all have their high interpreters among us;
but in the chance of life it has fallen out that there is
none to read aright for us, in historic retrospect, what
after ages will probably regard as the most salient
feature of the nineteenth century&mdash;the conflict of theology
with philosophy and science. The pens of our
Huxleys, and Tyndalls, and Darwins lie where they
fell; there is none left in strength among us to sum
up the issues of that struggle with knowledge and
sympathy.</p>

<p>In these circumstances it has been thought fitting
that we should introduce to English readers the latest
work of Professor Haeckel. Germany, as the reader
will quickly perceive, is witnessing the same strange
reaction of thought that we see about us here in England,
yet <i>Die Welträthsel</i> found an immediate and very
extensive circle of readers. One of the most prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
zoologists of the century, Professor Haeckel, has a
unique claim to pronounce with authority, from the
scientific side, on what is known as &ldquo;the conflict of
science and religion.&rdquo; In the contradictory estimates
that are urged on us&mdash;for the modern ecclesiastic is
as emphatic in his assurance that the conflict has
ended favorably to theology as the rationalist is with
his counter-assertion&mdash;the last words of one of the
leading combatants of the second half of the century,
still, happily, in full vigor of mind, will be heard with
respect and close attention.</p>

<p>A glance at the index of the work suffices to indicate
its comprehensive character. The judgment of the distinguished
scientist cannot fail to have weight on all
the topics included; yet the reader will soon discover
a vein of exceptionally interesting thought in the chapters
on evolution. The evolution of the human body
is no longer a matter of serious dispute. It has passed
the first two tribunals&mdash;those of theology and of an <i>à
priori</i> philosophy&mdash;and is only challenged at the third
and last&mdash;that of empirical proof&mdash;by the decorative
heads of scientific bodies and a few isolated thinkers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Apparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto.</i>&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>But the question of the evolution of the human mind,
or soul, has been successfully divorced from that of
the body. Roman Catholic advanced theologians,
whose precise terminology demanded a clear position,
admit the latter and deny the former categorically.
Other theologians, and many philosophers, have still
a vague notion that the evidence for the one does not
impair their sentimental objection to the other. Dr.
Haeckel&rsquo;s work summarizes the evidence for the evo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>lution
of mind in a masterly and profoundly interesting
fashion. It seems impossible to follow his broad survey
of the psychic world, from protist to man, without
bearing away a conviction of the natural origin of
every power and content of the human soul.</p>

<p>The close of the nineteenth century offers one of the
most remarkable spectacles to the thoughtful observer.
All educated people are agreed that it has in
many respects immeasurably outstripped its predecessors,
and has achieved tasks that were deemed impracticable
at its commencement. An entirely new character
has been given to the whole of our modern civilization,
not only by our astounding theoretical progress in sound
knowledge of nature, but also by the remarkably fertile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
practical application of that knowledge in technical
science, industry, commerce, and so forth. On the
other hand, however, we have made little or no progress
in moral and social life, in comparison with earlier
centuries; at times there has been serious reaction.
And from this obvious conflict there have arisen, not
only an uneasy sense of dismemberment and falseness,
but even the danger of grave catastrophes in the political
and social world. It is, then, not merely the right,
but the sacred duty, of every honorable and humanitarian
thinker to devote himself conscientiously to the
settlement of that conflict, and to warding off the dangers
that it brings in its train. In our conviction this
can only be done by a courageous effort to attain the
truth, and by the formation of a clear view of the world&mdash;a
view that shall be based on truth and conformity
to reality.</p>

<p>If we recall to mind the imperfect condition of science
at the beginning of the century, and compare this with
the magnificent structure of its closing years, we are
compelled to admit that marvellous progress has been
made during its course. Every single branch of science
can boast that it has, especially during the latter half
of the century, made numerous acquisitions of the utmost
value. Both in our microscopic knowledge of the
little and in our telescopic investigation of the great
we have attained an invaluable insight that seemed inconceivable
a hundred years ago. Improved methods of
microscopic and biological research have not only revealed
to us an invisible world of living things in the
kingdom of the protists, full of an infinite wealth of
forms, but they have taught us to recognize in the tiny
cell the all-pervading &ldquo;elementary organism&rdquo; of whose
social communities&mdash;the tissues&mdash;the body of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
multicellular plant and animal, even that of man, is
composed. This anatomical knowledge is of extreme
importance; and it is supplemented by the embryological
discovery that each of the higher multicellular
organisms is developed out of one simple cell, the impregnated
ovum. The &ldquo;cellular theory,&rdquo; which has
been founded on that discovery, has given us the first
true interpretation of the physical, chemical, and even
the psychological processes of life&mdash;those mysterious
phenomena for whose explanation it had been customary
to postulate a supernatural &ldquo;vital force&rdquo; or &ldquo;immortal
soul.&rdquo; Moreover, the true character of disease
has been made clear and intelligible to the physician
for the first time by the cognate science of Cellular
Pathology.</p>

<p>The discoveries of the nineteenth century in the inorganic
world are no less important. Physics has made
astounding progress in every section of its province&mdash;in
optics and acoustics, in magnetism and electricity,
in mechanics and thermo-dynamics; and, what is still
more important, it has proved the unity of the forces
of the entire universe. The mechanical theory of heat
has shown how intimately they are connected, and how
each can, in certain conditions, transform itself directly
into another. Spectral analysis has taught us that the
same matter which enters into the composition of all
bodies on earth, including its living inhabitants, builds
up the rest of the planets, the sun, and the most distant
stars. Astro-physics has considerably enlarged our
cosmic perspective in revealing to us, in the immeasurable
depths of space, millions of circling spheres larger
than our earth, and, like it, in endless transformation,
in an eternal rhythm of life and death. Chemistry has
introduced us to a multitude of new substances, all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
which arise from the combination of a few (about seventy)
elements that are incapable of further analysis;
some of them play a most important part in every branch
of life. It has been shown that one of these elements&mdash;carbon&mdash;is
the remarkable substance that effects the
endless variety of organic syntheses, and thus may be
considered &ldquo;the chemical basis of life.&rdquo; All the particular
advances, however, of physics and chemistry
yield in theoretical importance to the discovery of the
great law which brings them all to one common focus,
the &ldquo;Law of Substance.&rdquo; As this fundamental cosmic
law establishes the eternal persistence of matter and
force, their unvarying constancy throughout the entire
universe, it has become the pole-star that guides our
Monistic Philosophy through the mighty labyrinth to
a solution of the world-problem.</p>

<p>Since we intend to make a general survey of the actual
condition of our knowledge of nature and its progress
during the present century in the following chapters,
we shall delay no longer with the review of its
particular branches. We would only mention one important
advance, which was contemporary with the discovery
of the law of substance, and which supplements
it&mdash;the establishment of the theory of evolution. It is
true that there were philosophers who spoke of the evolution
of things a thousand years ago; but the recognition
that such a law dominates the entire universe, and
that the world is nothing else than an eternal &ldquo;evolution
of substance,&rdquo; is a fruit of the nineteenth century. It
was not until the second half of this century that it attained
to perfect clearness and a universal application.
The immortal merit of establishing the doctrine on an
empirical basis, and pointing out its world-wide application,
belongs to the great scientist Charles Darwin;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
he it was who, in 1859, supplied a solid foundation for
the theory of descent, which the able French naturalist
Jean Lamarck had already sketched in its broad outlines
in 1809, and the fundamental idea of which had
been almost prophetically enunciated in 1799 by Germany&rsquo;s
greatest poet and thinker, Wolfgang Goethe.
In that theory we have the key to &ldquo;the question of all
questions,&rdquo; to the great enigma of &ldquo;the place of man in
nature,&rdquo; and of his natural development. If we are in
a position to-day to recognize the sovereignty of the
law of evolution&mdash;and, indeed, of a monistic evolution&mdash;in
every province of nature, and to use it, in conjunction
with the law of substance, for a simple interpretation
of all natural phenomena, we owe it chiefly to those
three distinguished naturalists; they shine as three
stars of the first magnitude amid all the great men of
the century.</p>

<p>This marvellous progress in a theoretical knowledge
of nature has been followed by a manifold practical application
in every branch of civilized life. If we are to-day
in the &ldquo;age of commerce,&rdquo; if international trade
and communication have attained dimensions beyond
the conception of any previous age, if we have transcended
the limits of space and time by our telegraph
and telephone, we owe it, in the first place, to the technical
advancement of physics, especially in the application
of steam and electricity. If, in photography,
we can, with the utmost ease, compel the sunbeam to
create for us in a moment&rsquo;s time a correct picture of
any object we like; if we have made enormous progress
in agriculture, and in a variety of other pursuits; if, in
surgery, we have brought an infinite relief to human
pain by our chloroform and morphia, our antiseptics
and serous therapeutics, we owe it all to applied chem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>istry.
But it is so well known how much we have surpassed
all earlier centuries through these and other scientific
discoveries that we need linger over the question
no longer.</p>

<p>While we look back with a just pride on the immense
progress of the nineteenth century in a knowledge of
nature and in its practical application, we find, unfortunately,
a very different and far from agreeable picture
when we turn to another and not less important province
of modern life. To our great regret we must endorse
the words of Alfred Wallace: &ldquo;Compared with
our astounding progress in physical science and its
practical application, our system of government, of administrative
justice, and of national education, and our
entire social and moral organization, remain in a state
of barbarism.&rdquo; To convince ourselves of the truth of
this grave indictment we need only cast an unprejudiced
glance at our public life, or look into the mirror that is
daily offered to us by the press, the organ of public sentiment.</p>

<p>We begin our review with justice, the <i>fundamentum
regnorum</i>. No one can maintain that its condition to-day
is in harmony with our advanced knowledge of
man and the world. Not a week passes in which we
do not read of judicial decisions over which every
thoughtful man shakes his head in despair; many of
the decisions of our higher and lower courts are simply
unintelligible. We are not referring in the treatment
of this particular &ldquo;world-problem&rdquo; to the fact that
many modern states, in spite of their paper constitutions,
are really governed with absolute despotism, and
that many who occupy the bench give judgment less
in accordance with their sincere conviction than with
wishes expressed in higher quarters. We readily ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>mit
that the majority of judges and counsel decide conscientiously,
and err simply from human frailty. Most
of their errors, indeed, are due to defective preparation.
It is popularly supposed that these are just the men of
highest education, and that on that very account they
have the preference in nominations to different offices.
However, this famed &ldquo;legal education&rdquo; is for the most
part rather of a formal and technical character. They
have but a superficial acquaintance with that chief and
peculiar object of their activity, the human organism,
and its most important function, the mind. That is evident
from the curious views as to the liberty of the will,
responsibility, etc., which we encounter daily. I once
told an eminent jurist that the tiny spherical ovum from
which every man is developed is as truly endowed with
life as the embryo of two, or seven, or even nine months;
he laughed incredulously. Most of the students of jurisprudence
have no acquaintance with anthropology,
psychology, and the doctrine of evolution&mdash;the very
first requisites for a correct estimate of human nature.
They have &ldquo;no time&rdquo; for it; their time is already too
largely bespoken for an exhaustive study of beer and
wine and for the noble art of fencing. The rest of their
valuable study-time is required for the purpose of learning
some hundreds of paragraphs of law books, a
knowledge of which is supposed to qualify the jurist
for any position whatever in our modern civilized community.</p>

<p>We shall touch but lightly on the unfortunate province
of politics, for the unsatisfactory condition of the
modern political world is only too familiar. In a great
measure its evils are due to the fact that most of our
officials are jurists&mdash;that is, men of high technical education,
but utterly devoid of that thorough knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
of human nature which is only obtained by the study
of comparative anthropology and the monistic psychology&mdash;men
without an acquaintance with those social
relations of which we find the earlier types in comparative
zoology and the theory of evolution, in the cellular
theory, and the study of the protists. We can only arrive
at a correct knowledge of the structure and life of
the social body, the state, through a scientific knowledge
of the structure and life of the individuals who
compose it, and the cells of which they are in turn composed.
If our political rulers and our &ldquo;representatives
of the people&rdquo; possessed this invaluable biological and
anthropological knowledge, we should not find our
journals so full of the sociological blunders and political
nonsense which at present are far from adorning our
parliamentary reports, and even many of our official
documents. Worst of all is it when the modern state
flings itself into the arms of the reactionary Church,
and when the narrow-minded self-interest of parties
and the infatuation of short-sighted party-leaders lend
their support to the hierarchy. Then are witnessed
such sad scenes as the German Reichstag puts before
our eyes even at the close of the nineteenth century. We
have the spectacle of the educated German people in
the power of the ultramontane Centre, under the rule
of the Roman papacy, which is its bitterest and most
dangerous enemy. Then superstition and stupidity
reign instead of right and reason. Never will our government
improve until it casts off the fetters of the
Church and raises the views of the citizens on man and
the world to a higher level by a general scientific education.
That does not raise the question of any special
form of constitution. Whether a monarchy or a republic
be preferable, whether the constitution should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
aristocratic or democratic, are subordinate questions in
comparison with the supreme question: Shall the modern
civilized state be spiritual or secular? Shall it be
<i>theocratic</i>&mdash;ruled by the irrational formulæ of faith and
by clerical despotism&mdash;or <i>nomocratic</i>&mdash;under the sovereignty
of rational laws and civic right? The first
task is to kindle a rational interest in our youth, and to
uplift our citizens and free them from superstition. That
can only be achieved by a timely reform of our schools.</p>

<p>Our education of the young is no more in harmony
with modern scientific progress than our legal and political
world. Physical science, which is so much more
important than all other sciences, and which, properly
understood, really embraces all the so-called moral
sciences, is still regarded as a mere accessory in our
schools, if not treated as the Cinderella of the curriculum.
Most of our teachers still give the most prominent
place to that dead learning which has come down
from the cloistral schools of the Middle Ages. In the
front rank we have grammatical gymnastics and an
immense waste of time over a &ldquo;thorough knowledge&rdquo;
of classics and of the history of foreign nations. Ethics,
the most important object of practical philosophy, is
entirely neglected, and its place is usurped by the ecclesiastical
creed. Faith must take precedence over knowledge&mdash;not
that scientific faith which leads to a monistic
religion, but the irrational superstition that lays the
foundation of a perverted Christianity. The valuable
teaching of modern cosmology and anthropology, of
biology and evolution, is most inadequately imparted,
if not entirely unknown, in our higher schools; while
the memory is burdened with a mass of philological
and historical facts which are utterly useless, either
from the point of view of theoretical education or for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the practical purposes of life. Moreover, the antiquated
arrangements and the distribution of faculties in the
universities are just as little in harmony with the point
we have reached in monistic science as the curriculum
of the primary and secondary schools.</p>

<p>The climax of the opposition to modern education and
its foundation, advanced natural philosophy, is reached,
of course, in the Church. We are not speaking here of
ultramontane papistry, nor of the orthodox evangelical
tendencies, which do not fall far short of it in ignorance
and in the crass superstition of their dogmas. We
are imagining ourselves for the moment to be in the
church of a liberal Protestant minister, who has a good
average education, and who finds room for &ldquo;the rights
of reason&rdquo; by the side of his faith. There, besides excellent
moral teaching, which is in perfect harmony with
our own monistic ethics, and humanitarian discussion
of which we cordially approve, we hear ideas on the
nature of God, of the world, of man, and of life which
are directly opposed to all scientific experience. It is
no wonder that physicists and chemists, doctors and
philosophers, who have made a thorough study of nature,
refuse a hearing to such preachers. Our theologians
and our politicians are just as ignorant as our
philosophers and our jurists of that elementary knowledge
of nature which is based on the monistic theory of
evolution, and which is already far exceeded in the triumph
of our modern learning.</p>

<p>From this opposition, which we can only briefly point
out at present, there arise grave conflicts in our modern
life which urgently demand a settlement. Our modern
education, the outcome of our great advance in knowledge,
has a claim upon every department of public and
private life; it would see humanity raised, by the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>strumentality
of reason, to that higher grade of culture,
and, consequently, to that better path towards happiness
which has been opened out to us by the progress
of modern science. That aim, however, is vigorously
opposed by the influential parties who would detain the
mind in the exploded views of the Middle Ages with regard
to the most important problems of life; they linger
in the fold of traditional dogma, and would have reason
prostrate itself before their &ldquo;higher revelation.&rdquo; That
is the condition of things, to a very large extent, in theology
and philosophy, in sociology and jurisprudence.
It is not that the motives of the latter are to be attributed,
as a rule, to pure self-interest; they spring partly from
ignorance of the facts, and partly from an indolent acquiescence
in tradition. The most dangerous of the
three great enemies of reason and knowledge is not
malice; but ignorance, or, perhaps, indolence. The
gods themselves still strive in vain against these two
latter influences when they have happily vanquished
the first.</p>

<p>One of the main supports of that reactionary system
is still what we may call &ldquo;anthropism.&rdquo; I designate by
this term &ldquo;that powerful and world-wide group of erroneous
opinions which opposes the human organism to
the whole of the rest of nature, and represents it to be
the preordained end of the organic creation, an entity
essentially distinct from it, a godlike being.&rdquo; Closer
examination of this group of ideas shows it to be made
up of three different dogmas, which we may distinguish
as the <i>anthropocentric</i>, the <i>anthropomorphic</i>, and the
<i>anthropolatrous</i>.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>I. The <i>anthropocentric</i> dogma culminates in the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
that man is the preordained centre and aim of all terrestrial
life&mdash;or, in a wider sense, of the whole universe.
As this error is extremely conducive to man&rsquo;s interest,
and as it is intimately connected with the creation-myth
of the three great Mediterranean religions, and with the
dogmas of the Mosaic, Christian, and Mohammedan
theologies, it still dominates the greater part of the civilized
world.</p>

<p>II. The <i>anthropomorphic</i> dogma is likewise connected
with the creation-myth of the three aforesaid religions,
and of many others. It likens the creation and control
of the world by God to the artificial creation of a talented
engineer or mechanic, and to the administration
of a wise ruler. God, as creator, sustainer, and ruler
of the world, is thus represented after a purely human
fashion in his thought and work. Hence it follows, in
turn, that man is godlike. &ldquo;God made man to His
own image and likeness.&rdquo; The older, naïve mythology
is pure &ldquo;homotheism,&rdquo; attributing human shape, flesh,
and blood to the gods. It is more intelligible than the
modern mystic theosophy that adores a personal God
as an invisible&mdash;properly speaking, gaseous&mdash;being,
yet makes him think, speak, and act in human fashion;
it gives us the paradoxical picture of a &ldquo;gaseous vertebrate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>III. The <i>anthropolatric</i> dogma naturally results from
this comparison of the activity of God and man; it ends
in the apotheosis of the human organism. A further
result is the belief in the personal immortality of the
soul, and the dualistic dogma of the twofold nature of
man, whose &ldquo;immortal soul&rdquo; is conceived as but the
temporary inhabitant of the mortal frame. Thus these
three anthropistic dogmas, variously adapted to the respective
professions of the different religions, came at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
length to be vested with an extraordinary importance,
and proved the source of the most dangerous errors.
The anthropistic view of the world which springs from
them is in irreconcilable opposition to our monistic system;
indeed, it is at once disproved by our new cosmological
perspective.</p>

<p>Not only the three anthropistic dogmas, but many
other notions of the dualistic philosophy and orthodox
religion, are found to be untenable as soon as we regard
them critically from the cosmological perspective of our
monistic system. We understand by that the comprehensive
view of the universe which we have from the
highest point of our monistic interpretation of nature.
From that stand-point we see the truth of the following
&ldquo;cosmological theorems,&rdquo; most of which, in our opinion,
have already been amply demonstrated:</p>

<p>(1) The universe, or the cosmos, is eternal, infinite,
and illimitable. (2) Its substance, with its two attributes
(matter and energy), fills infinite space, and is in
eternal motion. (3) This motion runs on through infinite
time as an unbroken development, with a periodic
change from life to death, from evolution to devolution.
(4) The innumerable bodies which are scattered
about the space-filling ether all obey the same
&ldquo;law of substance;&rdquo; while the rotating masses slowly
move towards their destruction and dissolution in one
part of space others are springing into new life and
development in other quarters of the universe. (5) Our
sun is one of these unnumbered perishable bodies, and
our earth is one of the countless transitory planets that
encircle them. (6) Our earth has gone through a long
process of cooling before water, in liquid form (the first
condition of organic life), could settle thereon. (7) The
ensuing biogenetic process, the slow development and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
transformation of countless organic forms, must have
taken many millions of years&mdash;considerably over a hundred.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
(8) Among the different kinds of animals which
arose in the later stages of the biogenetic process on
earth the vertebrates have far outstripped all other competitors
in the evolutionary race. (9) The most important
branch of the vertebrates, the mammals, were developed
later (during the triassic period) from the lower
amphibia and the reptilia. (10) The most perfect and
most highly developed branch of the class mammalia
is the order of primates, which first put in an appearance,
by development from the lowest prochoriata, at
the beginning of the Tertiary period&mdash;at least three million
years ago. (11) The youngest and most perfect
twig of the branch primates is man, who sprang from
a series of manlike apes towards the end of the Tertiary
period. (12) Consequently, the so-called &ldquo;history of the
world&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the brief period of a few thousand
years which measures the duration of civilization&mdash;is
an evanescently short episode in the long course of organic
evolution, just as this, in turn, is merely a small
portion of the history of our planetary system; and as
our mother-earth is a mere speck in the sunbeam in the
illimitable universe, so man himself is but a tiny grain
of protoplasm in the perishable framework of organic
nature.</p>

<p>Nothing seems to me better adapted than this magnificent
cosmological perspective to give us the proper
standard and the broad outlook which we need in the
solution of the vast enigmas that surround us. It not
only clearly indicates the true place of man in nature,
but it dissipates the prevalent illusion of man&rsquo;s supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
importance, and the arrogance with which he sets himself
apart from the illimitable universe, and exalts himself
to the position of its most valuable element. This
boundless presumption of conceited man has misled
him into making himself &ldquo;the image of God,&rdquo; claiming
an &ldquo;eternal life&rdquo; for his ephemeral personality, and
imagining that he possesses unlimited &ldquo;freedom of
will.&rdquo; The ridiculous imperial folly of Caligula is but
a special form of man&rsquo;s arrogant assumption of divinity.
Only when we have abandoned this untenable
illusion, and taken up the correct cosmological perspective,
can we hope to reach the solution of the &ldquo;riddles
of the universe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The uneducated member of a civilized community is
surrounded with countless enigmas at every step, just
as truly as the savage. Their number, however, decreases
with every stride of civilization and of science;
and the monistic philosophy is ultimately confronted
with but one simple and comprehensive enigma&mdash;the
&ldquo;problem of substance.&rdquo; Still, we may find it useful
to include a certain number of problems under that title.
In the famous speech which Emil du Bois-Reymond delivered
in 1880, in the Leibnitz session of the Berlin Academy
of Sciences, he distinguished seven world-enigmas,
which he enumerated as follows: (1) The nature of
matter and force. (2) The origin of motion. (3) The
origin of life. (4) The (apparently preordained) orderly
arrangement of nature. (5) The origin of simple
sensation and consciousness. (6) Rational thought,
and the origin of the cognate faculty, speech. (7) The
question of the freedom of the will. Three of these seven
enigmas are considered by the orator of the Berlin
Academy to be entirely transcendental and insoluble&mdash;they
are the first, second, and fifth; three others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
(the third, fourth, and sixth) he considers to be capable
of solution, though extremely difficult; as to the seventh
and last &ldquo;world-enigma,&rdquo; the freedom of the will,
which is the one of the greatest practical importance,
he remains undecided.</p>

<p>As my monism differs materially from that of the Berlin
orator, and as his idea of the &ldquo;seven great enigmas&rdquo;
has been very widely accepted, it may be useful to indicate
their true position at once. In my opinion, the
three transcendental problems (1, 2, and 5) are settled
by our conception of substance (<i>vide</i> <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">chap. xii</a>.); the
three which he considers difficult, though soluble, (3, 4,
and 6), are decisively answered by our modern theory
of evolution; the seventh and last, the freedom of the
will, is not an object for critical, scientific inquiry at all,
for it is a pure dogma, based on an illusion, and has no
real existence.</p>

<p>The means and methods we have chosen for attaining
the solution of the great enigma do not differ, on
the whole, from those of all purely scientific investigation&mdash;firstly,
experience; secondly, inference. Scientific
experience comes to us by observation and experiment,
which involve the activity of our sense-organs in
the first place, and, secondly, of the inner sense-centres
in the cortex of the brain. The microscopic elementary
organs of the former are the sense-cells; of the latter,
groups of ganglionic cells. The experiences which we
derive from the outer world by these invaluable instruments
of our mental life are then moulded into ideas by
other parts of the brain, and these, in their turn, are
united in a chain of reasoning by association. The construction
of this chain may take place in two different
ways, which are, in my opinion, equally valuable and
indispensable: <i>induction</i> and <i>deduction</i>. The higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
cerebral operations, the construction of complicated
chains of reasoning, abstraction, the formation of concepts,
the completion of the perceptive faculty by the
plastic faculty of the imagination&mdash;in a word, consciousness,
thought, and speculation&mdash;are functions of the
ganglionic cells of the cortex of the brain, just like the
preceding simpler mental functions. We unite them
all in the supreme concept of <i>reason</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>By reason only can we attain to a correct knowledge
of the world and a solution of its great problems. Reason
is man&rsquo;s highest gift, the only prerogative that essentially
distinguishes him from the lower animals.
Nevertheless, it has only reached this high position by
the progress of culture and education, by the development
of knowledge. The uneducated man and the savage
are just as little (or just as much) &ldquo;rational&rdquo; as
our nearest relatives among the mammals (apes, dogs,
elephants, etc.). Yet the opinion still obtains in many
quarters that, besides our godlike reason, we have two
further (and even surer!) methods of receiving knowledge&mdash;emotion
and revelation. We must at once dispose
of this dangerous error. Emotion has nothing
whatever to do with the attainment of truth. That
which we prize under the name of &ldquo;emotion&rdquo; is an
elaborate activity of the brain, which consists of feelings
of like and dislike, motions of assent and dissent,
impulses of desire and aversion. It may be influenced
by the most diverse activities of the organism, by the
cravings of the senses and the muscles, the stomach,
the sexual organs, etc. The interests of truth are far
from promoted by these conditions and vacillations of
emotion; on the contrary, such circumstances often dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>turb
that reason which alone is adapted to the pursuit
of truth, and frequently mar its perceptive power. No
cosmic problem is solved, or even advanced, by the cerebral
function we call emotion. And the same must be
said of the so-called &ldquo;revelation,&rdquo; and of the &ldquo;truths
of faith&rdquo; which it is supposed to communicate; they
are based entirely on a deception, consciously or unconsciously,
as we shall see in the <a href="#CHAPTER_XVI">sixteenth chapter</a>.</p>

<p>We must welcome as one of the most fortunate steps
in the direction of a solution of the great cosmic problems
the fact that of recent years there is a growing
tendency to recognize the two paths which alone lead
thereto&mdash;<i>experience</i> and <i>thought</i>, or <i>speculation</i>&mdash;to be
of equal value, and mutually complementary. Philosophers
have come to see that pure speculation&mdash;such,
for instance, as Plato and Hegel employed for
the construction of their <i>idealist</i> systems&mdash;does not
lead to knowledge of reality. On the other hand, scientists
have been convinced that mere experience&mdash;such
as Bacon and Mill, for example, made the basis
of their <i>realist</i> systems&mdash;is insufficient of itself for a
complete philosophy. For these two great paths of
knowledge, sense-experience and rational thought, are
two distinct cerebral functions; the one is elaborated
by the sense-organs and the inner sense-centres, the
other by the thought-centres, the great &ldquo;centres of
association in the cortex of the brain,&rdquo; which lie between
the sense-centres. (Cf. cc. <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">vii</a>. and <a href="#CHAPTER_X">x</a>.) True
knowledge is only acquired by combining the activity
of the two. Nevertheless, there are still many philosophers
who would construct the world out of their
own inner consciousness, and who reject our empirical
science precisely because they have no knowledge of
the real world. On the other hand, there are many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
scientists who still contend that the sole object of science
is &ldquo;the knowledge of facts, the objective investigation
of isolated phenomena&rdquo;; that &ldquo;the age of philosophy&rdquo;
is past, and science has taken its place.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This
one-sided over-estimation of experience is as dangerous
an error as the converse exaggeration of the value of
speculation. Both channels of knowledge are mutually
indispensable. The greatest triumphs of modern
science&mdash;the cellular theory, the dynamic theory of
heat, the theory of evolution, and the law of substance&mdash;are
<i>philosophic achievements</i>; not, however, the fruit
of pure speculation, but of an antecedent experience of
the widest and most searching character.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the nineteenth century the
great idealistic poet, Schiller, gave his counsel to both
groups of combatants, the philosophers and the scientists:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Does strife divide your efforts&mdash;no union bless your toil?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will truth e&rsquo;er be delivered if ye your forces rend?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Since then the situation has, happily, been profoundly
modified; while both schools, in their different paths,
have pressed onward towards the same high goal,
they have recognized their common aspiration, and
they draw nearer to a knowledge of the truth in mutual
covenant. At the end of the nineteenth century we
have returned to that monistic attitude which our
greatest realistic poet, Goethe, had recognized from its
very commencement to be alone correct and fruitful.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>All the different philosophical tendencies may, from
the point of view of modern science, be ranged in two
antagonistic groups; they represent either a <i>dualistic</i>
or a <i>monistic</i> interpretation of the cosmos. The former
is usually bound up with teleological and idealistic
dogmas, the latter with mechanical and realistic
theories. Dualism, in the widest sense, breaks up the
universe into two entirely distinct substances&mdash;the
material world and an immaterial God, who is represented
to be its creator, sustainer, and ruler. Monism,
on the contrary (likewise taken in its widest sense),
recognizes one sole substance in the universe, which
is at once &ldquo;God and nature&rdquo;; body and spirit (or matter
and energy) it holds to be inseparable. The extramundane
God of dualism leads necessarily to theism;
and the intra-mundane God of the monist leads to
pantheism.</p>

<p>The different ideas of <i>monism</i> and <i>materialism</i>, and
likewise the essentially distinct tendencies of theoretical
and practical materialism, are still very frequently
confused. As this and other similar cases of confusion
of ideas are very prejudicial, and give rise to innumerable
errors, we shall make the following brief
observations, in order to prevent misunderstanding:</p>

<p>I. Pure monism is identical neither with the theoretical
materialism that denies the existence of spirit,
and dissolves the world into a heap of dead atoms, nor
with the theoretical spiritualism (lately entitled &ldquo;energetic&rdquo;
spiritualism by Ostwald) which rejects the notion
of matter, and considers the world to be a specially
arranged group of &ldquo;energies&rdquo; or immaterial natural
forces.</p>

<p>II. On the contrary, we hold, with Goethe, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>&ldquo;matter cannot exist and be operative without spirit,
nor spirit without matter.&rdquo; We adhere firmly to the
pure, unequivocal monism of Spinoza: Matter, or infinitely
extended substance, and spirit (or energy), or
sensitive and thinking substance, are the two fundamental
attributes or principal properties of the all-embracing
divine essence of the world, the universal
substance. (Cf. <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">chap. xii</a>.)</p>

<p>All biological research, all investigation into the
forms and vital activities of organisms, must
first deal with the visible body, in which the morphological
and physiological phenomena are observed.
This fundamental rule holds good for man
just as much as for all other living things. Moreover,
the inquiry must not confine itself to mere observation
of the outer form; it must penetrate to the
interior, and study both the general plan and the minute
details of the structure. The science which pursues
this fundamental investigation in the broadest
sense is anatomy.</p>

<p>The first stimulus to an inquiry into the human
frame arose, naturally, in medicine. As it was usually
practised by the priests in the older civilizations, we
may assume that these highest representatives of the
education of the time had already acquired a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
amount of anatomical knowledge two thousand years
before Christ, or even earlier. We do not, however,
find more exact observations, founded on the dissection
of mammals, and applied, by analogy, to the human
frame, until we come to the Greek scientists of the sixth
and fifth centuries before Christ&mdash;Empedocles (of Agrigentum)
and Democritus (of Abdera), and especially
the most famous physician of classic antiquity, Hippocrates
(of Cos). It was from these and other sources
that the great Aristotle, the renowned &ldquo;father of natural
history,&rdquo; equally comprehensive as investigator and
philosopher, derived his first knowledge. After him
only one anatomist of any consequence is found in antiquity,
the Greek physician Claudius Galenus (of Pergamus),
who developed a wealthy practice in Rome in
the second century after Christ, under the Emperor
Marcus Aurelius. All these ancient anatomists acquired
their knowledge, as a rule, not by the dissection
of the human body itself&mdash;which was then sternly forbidden&mdash;but
by a study of the bodies of the animals
which most closely resembled man, especially the apes;
they were all, indeed, comparative anatomists.</p>

<p>The triumph of Christianity and its mystic theories
meant retrogression to anatomy, as it did to all the other
sciences. The popes were resolved above all things to
detain humanity in ignorance; they rightly deemed a
knowledge of the human organism to be a dangerous
source of enlightenment as to our true nature. During
the long period of thirteen centuries the writings of Galen
were almost the only source of human anatomy,
just as the works of Aristotle were for the whole of natural
history. It was not until the sixteenth century,
when the spiritual tyranny of the papacy was broken
by the Reformation, and the geocentric theory, so in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>timately
connected with papal doctrine, was destroyed
by the new cosmic system of Copernicus, that the
knowledge of the human frame entered upon a new period
of progress. The great anatomists, Vesalius (of
Brussels), and Eustachius and Fallopius (of Modena),
advanced the knowledge of our bodily structure so much
by their own thorough investigations that little remained
for their numerous followers to do, with regard
to the more obvious phenomena, except the substantiation
of details. Andreas Vesalius, as courageous as
he was talented and indefatigable, was the pioneer of
the movement; he completed in his twenty-eighth year
(1543) that great and systematic work <i>De humani corporis
fabrica</i>; he gave to the whole of human anatomy
a new and independent scope and a more solid
foundation. On that account he was, at a later date,
at Madrid&mdash;where he was physician to Charles V. and
Philip II.&mdash;condemned to death by the Inquisition as
a magician. He only escaped by undertaking a pilgrimage
to Jerusalem; in returning he suffered shipwreck
on the Isle of Zante, and died there in misery and
destitution.</p>

<p>The great merit of the nineteenth century, as far as
our knowledge of the human frame is concerned, lies in
the founding of two new lines of research of immense
importance&mdash;comparative anatomy and histology, or
microscopic anatomy. The former was intimately associated
with human anatomy from the very beginning;
indeed, it had to supply the place of the latter so long
because the dissection of human corpses was a crime
visited with capital punishment&mdash;that was the case even
in the fifteenth century! But the many anatomists of
the next three centuries devoted themselves mainly to
a more accurate study of the human organism. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
elaborate science which we now call comparative anatomy
was born in the year 1803, when the great French
zoologist Georges Cuvier (a native of Mömpelgard, in
Alsace) published his profound <i>Leçons sur l&rsquo;anatomie
comparée</i>, and endeavored to formulate, for the first
time, definite laws as to the organism of man and the
beasts. While his predecessors&mdash;among whom was
Goethe in 1790&mdash;had mainly contented themselves with
comparing the skeleton of man with those of other animals,
Cuvier&rsquo;s broader vision took in the whole of the
animal organization. He distinguished therein four
great and mutually independent types: Vertebrata, Articulata,
Mollusca, and Radiata. This advance was
of extreme consequence for our &ldquo;question of all questions,&rdquo;
since it clearly brought out the fact that man
belonged to the vertebral type, and differed fundamentally
from all the other types. It is true that the keen-sighted
Linné had already, in his <i>Systema Natuae</i>,
made a great step in advance by assigning man a definite
place in the class of mammals; he had even drawn
up the three groups of half-apes, apes, and men (<i>Lemur</i>,
<i>simia</i>, and <i>homo</i>) in the order of primates. But his
keen, systematic mind was not furnished with that profound
empirical foundation, supplied by comparative
anatomy, which Cuvier was the first to attain. Further
developments were added by the great comparative
anatomists of our own century&mdash;Friedrich Meckel
(Halle), Johannes Müller (Berlin), Richard Owen, T.
Huxley, and Karl Gegenbaur (Jena, subsequently Heidelberg).
The last-named, in applying the evolutionary
theory, which Darwin had just established, to comparative
anatomy, raised his science to the front rank
of biological studies. The numerous comparative anatomical
works of Gegenbaur are, like his well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
<i>Manual of Human Anatomy</i>, equally distinguished
by a thorough empirical acquaintance with their immense
multitudes of facts, and by a comprehensive control
of his material, and its philosophic appreciation in
the evolutionary sense. His recent <i>Comparative Anatomy
of the Vertebrata</i> establishes the solid foundation
on which our conviction of the vertebral character of
man in every aspect is chiefly based.</p>

<p>Microscopic anatomy has been developed, in the
course of the present century, in a very different fashion
from comparative anatomy. At the beginning of
the century (1802) a French physician, Bichat, made an
attempt to dissect the organs of the human body into
their finer constituents by the aid of the microscope,
and to show the connection of these various <i>tissues</i>
(<i>hista</i>, or <i>tela</i>). This first attempt led to little result,
because the scientist was ignorant of the one common
element of all the different tissues. This was first discovered
(1838) in the shape of the <i>cell</i>, in the plant
world, by Matthias Schleiden, and immediately afterwards
proved to be the same in the animal world by
Theodor Schwann, the pupil and assistant of Johannes
Müller at Berlin. Two other distinguished
pupils of this great master, who are still living, Albert
Kölliker and Rudolph Virchow, took up the cellular
theory, and the theory of tissues which is founded on
it, in the sixties, and applied them to the human organism
in all its details, both in health and disease;
they proved that, in man and all other animals, every
tissue is made up of the same microscopic particles,
the <i>cells</i>, and these &ldquo;elementary organisms&rdquo; are the
real, self-active citizens which, in combinations of millions,
constitute the &ldquo;cellular state,&rdquo; our body. All these
cells spring from one simple cell, the <i>cytula</i>, or im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>pregnated
ovum, by continuous subdivision. The general
structure and combination of the tissues are the
same in man as in the other vertebrates. Among
these the mammals, the youngest and most highly
developed class take precedence, in virtue of certain
special features which were acquired late. Such are,
for instance, the microscopic texture of the hair, of the
glands of the skin, and of the breasts, and the corpuscles
of the blood, which are quite peculiar to mammals,
and different from those of the other vertebrates;
man, even in these finest histological relations,
is a <i>true mammal</i>.</p>

<p>The microscopic researches of Albert Kölliker and
Franz Leydig (at Würzburg) not only enlarged our
knowledge of the finer structure of man and the beasts
in every direction, but they were especially important
in the light of their connection with the evolution of
the cell and the tissue; they confirmed the great theory
of Carl Theodor Siebold (1845) that the lowest animals,
the Infusoria and the Rhizopods, are unicellular organisms.</p>

<p>Our whole frame, both in its general plan and its
detailed structure, presents the characteristic type of
the vertebrates. This most important and most highly
developed group in the animal world was first recognized
in its natural unity in 1801 by the great Lamarck;
he embraced under that title the four higher
animal groups of Linné&mdash;mammals, birds, amphibia,
and fishes. To these he opposed the two lower classes,
insects and worms, as invertebrates. Cuvier (1812)
established the unity of the vertebrate type on a firmer
basis by his comparative anatomy. It is quite true
that all the vertebrates, from the fish up to man, agree
in every essential feature; they all have a firm inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>nal
skeleton, a framework of cartilage and bone, consisting
principally of a vertebral column and a skull;
the advanced construction of the latter presents many
variations, but, on the whole, all may be reduced to
the same fundamental type. Further, in all vertebrates
the &ldquo;organ of the mind,&rdquo; the central nervous
system, in the shape of a spinal cord and a brain, lies
at the back of this axial skeleton. Moreover, what
we said of its bony environment, the skull, is also
true of the brain&mdash;the instrument of consciousness and
all the higher functions of the mind; its construction
and size present very many variations in detail, but
its general characteristic structure remains always the
same.</p>

<p>We meet the same phenomenon when we compare
the rest of our organs with those of the other vertebrates;
everywhere, in virtue of heredity, the original
plan and the relative distribution of the organs remain
the same, although, through adaptation to different
environments, the size and the structure of particular
sections offer considerable variation. Thus we find
that in all cases the blood circulates in two main blood-vessels,
of which one&mdash;the aorta&mdash;passes over the intestine,
and the other&mdash;the principal vein&mdash;passes underneath,
and that by the broadening out of the latter
in a very definite spot a heart has arisen; this &ldquo;ventral
heart&rdquo; is just as characteristic of all vertebrates as the
&ldquo;dorsal heart&rdquo; is of the articulata and mollusca.
Equally characteristic of all vertebrates is the early
division of the intestinal tube into a &ldquo;head-gut&rdquo; (or
gill-gut), which serves in respiration, and a &ldquo;body-gut&rdquo;
(or liver-gut), which co-operates with the liver in
digestion; so are, likewise, the ramification of the muscular
system, the peculiar structure of the urinary and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
sexual organs, and so forth. In all these anatomical
relations <i>man is a true vertebrate</i>.</p>

<p>Aristotle gave the name of four-footed, or tetrapoda,
to all the higher warm-blooded animals which are distinguished
by the possession of two pairs of legs. The
category was enlarged subsequently, and its title
changed into the Latin &ldquo;quadrupeda,&rdquo; when Cuvier
proved that even &ldquo;two-legged&rdquo; birds and men are
really &ldquo;four-footed&rdquo;; he showed that the internal
skeleton of the four legs in all the higher land-vertebrates,
from the amphibia up to man, was originally
constructed after the same pattern out of a definite
number of members. The &ldquo;arm&rdquo; of man and the
&ldquo;wing&rdquo; of bats and birds have the same typical skeleton
as the foreleg of the animals which are conspicuously
&ldquo;four-footed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The anatomical unity of the fully developed skeleton
in the four limbs of all tetrapods is very important.
In order to appreciate it fully one has only to compare
carefully the skeleton of a salamander or a frog with
that of a monkey or a man. One perceives at once
that the humeral zone in front and the pelvic zone behind
are made up of the same principal parts as in the
rest of the quadrupeds. We find in all cases that the
first section of the leg proper consists of one strong
marrow-bone (the <i>humerus</i>, in the forearm; the <i>femur</i>,
behind); the second part, on the contrary, originally
always consists of two bones (the <i>ulna</i> and <i>radius</i>, in
front; the <i>fibula</i> and <i>tibia</i>, behind). When we further
compare the developed structure of the foot proper we
are surprised to find that the small bones of which it
is made up are also similarly arranged and distributed
in every case: in the front limb the three groups of
bones of the forefoot (or &ldquo;hand&rdquo;) correspond in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
classes of the tetrapoda: (1) the <i>carpus</i>, (2) the <i>metacarpus</i>,
(3) the five fingers (<i>digiti anteriores</i>); in the
rear limb, similarly, we have always the same three
osseous groups of the hind foot: (1) the <i>tarsus</i>, (2) the
<i>metatarsus</i>, and (3) the five toes (<i>digiti posteriores</i>). It
was a very difficult task to reduce all these little bones
to one primitive type, and to establish the equivalence
(or homology) of the separate parts in all cases; they
present extreme variations of form and construction in
detail, sometimes being partly fused together and losing
their individuality. This great task was first successfully
achieved by the most eminent comparative anatomist
of our day, Karl Gegenbaur. He pointed out,
in his <i>Researches into the Comparative Anatomy of
the Vertebrata</i> (1864), how this characteristic &ldquo;five-toed
leg&rdquo; of the land tetrapods originally (not before the
Carboniferous period) arose out of the radiating fin
(the breast-fin, or the belly-fin) of the ancient fishes.
He had also, in his famous <i>Researches into the Skull of
the Vertebrata</i> (1872), deduced the younger skull of the
tetrapods from the oldest cranial form among the fishes,
that of the shark.</p>

<p>It is especially remarkable that the original number
of the toes (five) on each of the four feet, which first
appeared in the old amphibia of the Carboniferous
period, has, in virtue of a strict heredity, been preserved
even to the present day in man. Also, naturally
and harmoniously, the typical construction of the
joints, ligaments, muscles, and nerves of the two pairs
of legs has, in the main, remained the same as in the
rest of the &ldquo;four-footed.&rdquo; In all these important relations
<i>man is a true tetrapod</i>.</p>

<p>The mammals are the youngest and most advanced
class of the vertebrates. It is true they are derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
from the older class of amphibia, like birds and reptiles:
yet they are distinguished from all the other tetrapods
by a number of very striking anatomical features. Externally,
there is the clothing of the skin with hair, and
the possession of two kinds of skin glands&mdash;the sweat
glands and the sebaceous glands. A local development
of these glands on the abdominal skin gave rise
(probably during the Triassic period) to the organ which
is especially characteristic of the class, and from which
it derives its name&mdash;the <i>mammarium</i>. This important
instrument of lactation is made up of milk glands
(<i>mammae</i>) and the &ldquo;mammar-pouches&rdquo; (folds of the
abdominal skin); in its development the teats appear,
through which the young mammal sucks its mother&rsquo;s
milk. In internal structure the most remarkable feature
is the possession of a complete diaphragm, a muscular
wall which, in all mammals&mdash;and <i>only</i> in mammals&mdash;separates
the thoracic from the abdominal cavity; in
all other vertebrates there is no such separation. The
skull of mammals is distinguished by a number of remarkable
formations, especially in the maxillary apparatus
(the upper and lower jaws, and the temporal
bones). Moreover, the brain, the olfactory organ, the
heart, the lungs, the internal and external sexual organs,
the kidneys, and other parts of the body present
special peculiarities, both in general and detailed structure,
in the mammals; all these, taken collectively, point
unequivocally to an early derivation of the mammals
from the older groups of the reptiles and amphibia,
which must have taken place, at the latest, in the
Triassic period&mdash;at least twelve million years ago!
In all these important characteristics <i>man is a true
mammal</i>.</p>

<p>The numerous orders (12-33) which modern system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>atic
zoology distinguishes in the class of mammals
had been arranged in 1816 (by Blainville) in three natural
groups, which still hold good as sub-classes: (1)
the monotrema, (2) the marsupialia, and (3) the placentalia.
These three sub-classes not only differ in the important
respect of bodily structure and development,
but they correspond, also, to three different historical
stages in the formation of the class, as we shall see
later on. The monotremes of the Triassic period were
followed by the marsupials of the Jurassic, and these
by the placentals of the Cretaceous. Man belongs to
this, the youngest, sub-class; for he presents in his organization
all the features which distinguish the placentals
from the marsupials and the still older monotremes.
First of all, there is the peculiar organ which
gives a name to the placentals&mdash;the <i>placenta</i>. It serves
the purpose of nourishing the young mammal embryo
for a long time during its enclosure in the mother&rsquo;s
womb; it consists of blood-bearing tufts which grow
out of the chorion surrounding the embryo, and penetrate
corresponding cavities in the mucous membrane
of the maternal uterus; the delicate skin between the
two structures is so attenuated in this spot that the nutriment
in the mother&rsquo;s blood can pass directly into the
blood of the child. This excellent contrivance for nourishing
the embryo, which makes its first appearance at
a somewhat late date, gives the f&oelig;tus the opportunity
of a longer maintenance and a higher development in
the protecting womb; it is wanting in the <i>implacentalia</i>,
the two older sub-classes of the marsupials and
the monotremes. There are, likewise, other anatomical
features, particularly the higher development of the
brain and the absence of the marsupial bone, which
raise the placentals above all their implacental ances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>tors.
In all these important particulars <i>man is a true
placental</i>.</p>

<p>The very varied sub-class of the placentals has been
recently subdivided into a great number of orders; they
are usually put at from ten to sixteen, but when we include
the important extinct forms which have been recently
discovered the number runs up to from twenty to
twenty-six. In order to facilitate the study of these
numerous orders, and to obtain a deeper insight into
their kindred construction, it is very useful to form them
into great natural groups, which I have called &ldquo;legions.&rdquo;
In my latest attempt<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to arrange the advanced
system of placentals in phylogenetic order I have substituted
eight of these legions for the twenty-six orders,
and shown that these may be reduced to four main
groups. These, in turn, are traceable to one common
ancestral group of all the placentals, their fossil ancestors,
the <i>prochoriata</i> of the Cretaceous period. These
are directly connected with the marsupial ancestors of
the Jurassic period. We will only specify here, as the
most important living representatives of these four
main groups, the rodentia, the ungulata, the carnivora,
and the primates. To the legion of the primates belong
the prosimiæ (half-apes), the simiæ (real apes),
and man. All the members of these three orders agree
in many important features, and are at the same time
distinguished by these features from the other twenty-three
orders of placentals. They are especially conspicuous
for the length of their bones, which were originally
adapted to their arboreal manner of life. Their
hands and feet are five-fingered, and the long fingers
are excellently suited for grasping and embracing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
branches of trees; they are provided, either partially or
completely, with nails, but have no claws. The dentition
is complete, containing all four classes&mdash;incisors,
canine, premolars, and molars. Primates are also distinguished
from all the other placentals by important
features in the special construction of the skull and the
brain; and these are the more striking in proportion
to their development and the lateness of their appearance
in the history of the earth. In all these important
anatomical features our human organism agrees with
that of all the other primates: <i>man is a true primate</i>.</p>

<p>An impartial and thorough comparison of the bodily
structure of the primates forces us to distinguish two
orders in this most advanced legion of the mammalia&mdash;half-apes
(<i>prosimiae</i> or <i>hemipitheci</i>) and apes (<i>simiae</i>
or <i>pitheci</i>). The former seem in every respect to be the
lower and older, the latter to be the higher and younger
order. The womb of the half-ape is still double, or two-horned,
as it is in all the other mammals. In the true
ape, on the contrary, the right and left wombs have
completely amalgamated; they blend into a pear-shaped
womb, which the human mother possesses besides
the ape. In the skull of the apes, just as in that
of man, the orbits of the eyes are completely separated
from the temporal cavities by an osseous partition;
in the <i>prosimiae</i> this is either entirely wanting
or very imperfect. Finally, the cerebrum of the
<i>prosimia</i> is either quite smooth or very slightly furrowed,
and proportionately small; that of the true
ape is much larger, and the gray bed especially, the organ
of higher psychic activity, is much more developed;
the characteristic convolutions and furrows appear on
its surface exactly in proportion as the ape approaches
to man. In these and other important respects, par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>ticularly
in the construction of the face and the hands,
<i>man presents all the anatomical marks of a true ape</i>.</p>

<p>The extensive order of apes was divided by Geoffroi,
in 1812, into two sub-orders, which are still universally
accepted in systematic zoology&mdash;New World and Old
World monkeys, according to the hemisphere they respectively
inhabit. The American &ldquo;New World&rdquo; monkeys
are called <i>Platyrrhinae</i> (flat-nosed); their nose is
flat, and the nostrils divergent, with a broad partition.
The &ldquo;Old World&rdquo; monkeys, on the contrary, are called
collectively <i>Catarrhinae</i> (narrow-nosed); their nostrils
point downward, like man&rsquo;s, and the dividing cartilage
is narrow. A further difference between the two groups
is that the tympanum is superficial in the <i>platyrrhinae</i>,
but lies deeper, inside the petrous bone, in the <i>catarrhinae</i>;
in the latter a long and narrow bony passage
has been formed, while in the former it is still short and
wide, or even altogether wanting. Finally, we have a
much more important and decisive difference between
the two groups in the circumstance that all the Old
World monkeys have the same teeth as man&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>,
twenty deciduous and thirty-two permanent teeth (two
incisors, one canine, two premolars, and three molars in
each half of the jaw). The New World monkeys, on
the other hand, have an additional premolar in each
half-jaw, or thirty-six teeth altogether. The fact that
these anatomical differences of the two simian groups
are universal and conspicuous, and that they harmonize
with their geographical distribution in the two hemispheres,
fully authorizes a sharp systematic division
of the two, as well as the phylogenetic conclusion that
for a very long period (for more than a million years)
the two sub-orders have been developing quite independently
of each other in the western and eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
hemispheres. That is a most important point in view
of the genealogy of our race; for man bears all the
marks of a <i>true catarrhina</i>; he has descended from
some extinct member of this sub-order in the Old World.</p>

<p>The numerous types of <i>catarrhinae</i> which still survive
in Asia and Africa have been formed into two sections
for some time&mdash;the tailed, doglike apes (the <i>cynopitheci</i>)
and the tailless, manlike apes (the <i>anthropomorpha</i>).
The latter are much nearer to man than the
former, not only in the absence of a tail and in the general
build of the body (especially of the head), but also
on account of certain features which are unimportant
in themselves but very significant in their constancy.
The sacrum of the anthropoid ape, like that of man, is
made up of the fusion of five vertebræ; that of the <i>cynopithecus</i>
consists of three (more rarely four) sacral vertebræ.
The premolar teeth of the <i>cynopitheci</i> are greater
in length than breadth; those of the <i>anthropomorpha</i>
are broader than they are long; and the first molar
has four protuberances in the former, five in the latter.
Furthermore, the outer incisor of the lower jaw is broader
than the inner one in the manlike apes and man; in
the doglike ape it is the smaller. Finally, there is a
special significance in the fact, established by Selenka
in 1890, that the anthropoid apes share with man the
peculiar structure of the discoid <i>placenta</i>, the <i>decidua
reflexa</i>, and the pedicle of the allantois. In fact, even
a superficial comparison of the bodily structure of the
<i>anthropomorpha</i> which still survive makes it clear that
both the Asiatic (the orang-outang and the gibbous
ape) and the African (the gorilla and chimpanzee) representatives
of this group are nearer to man in build
than any of the <i>cynopitheci</i>. Under the latter group
we include the dog-faced papiomorpha, the baboon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the long-tailed monkey, at a very low stage. The anatomical
difference between these low papiomorpha and
the most highly developed anthropoid apes is greater
in every respect, whatever organ we take for comparison,
than the difference between the latter and man.
This instructive fact was established with great penetration
by the anatomist Robert Hartmann, in his work
on <i>The Anthropoid Apes</i>;<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> he proposed to divide the
order of <i>Simiae</i> in a new way&mdash;namely, into the two
great groups of <i>primaria</i> (man and the anthropoid ape)
and the <i>simiae</i> proper, or <i>pitheci</i> (the rest of the catarrhinæ
and all the platyrrhinæ). In any case, we have
a clear proof of <i>the close affinity of man and the anthropoid
ape</i>.</p>

<p>Thus comparative anatomy proves to the satisfaction
of every unprejudiced and critical student the significant
fact that the body of man and that of the anthropoid
ape are not only peculiarly similar, but they are
practically one and the same in every important respect.
The same two hundred bones, in the same order and
structure, make up our inner skeleton; the same three
hundred muscles effect our movements; the same hair
clothes our skin; the same groups of ganglionic cells
build up the marvellous structure of our brain; the
same four chambered heart is the central pulsometer in
our circulation; the same thirty-two teeth are set in the
same order in our jaws; the same salivary, hepatic, and
gastric glands compass our digestive process; the same
reproductive organs insure the maintenance of our race.</p>

<p>It is true that we find, on close examination, certain
minor differences in point of size and shape in most
of the organs of man and the ape; but we discover the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
same, or similar, differences between the higher and
lower races of men, when we make a careful comparison&mdash;even,
in fact, in a minute comparison of the various
individuals of our own race. We find no two persons
who have exactly the same size and form of nose,
ears, eyes, and so forth. One has only to compare attentively
these special features in many different persons
in any large company to convince one&rsquo;s self of the
astonishing diversity of their construction and the infinite
variability of specific forms. Not infrequently
even two sisters are so much unlike as to make their
origin from the same parents almost incredible. Yet
all these individual variations do not weaken the significance
of the fundamental similarity of structure;
they are traceable to certain minute differences in the
growth of the individual features.</p>

<p>It is only in the nineteenth century that our knowledge
of human life has attained the dignity of a
genuine, independent science; during the course of the
century it has developed into one of the highest, most
interesting, and most important branches of knowledge.
This &ldquo;science of the vital functions,&rdquo; physiology, had,
it is true, been regarded at a much earlier date as a desirable,
if not a necessary, condition of success in medical
treatment, and had been constantly associated with
anatomy, the science of the structure of the body. But
it was only much later, and much more slowly, than the
latter that it could be thoroughly studied, as it had to
contend with much more serious difficulties.</p>

<p>The idea of life, as the opposite of death, naturally
became the subject of speculation at a very early age.
In the living man, just as in other living animals, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
were certain peculiar changes, especially movements,
which were wanting in lifeless nature: spontaneous
locomotion, the beat of the heart, the drawing of the
breath, speech, and so forth. But the discrimination
of such &ldquo;organic movements&rdquo; from similar phenomena
in inorganic bodies was by no means easy, and was
frequently impossible; the flowing stream, the flickering
flame, the rushing wind, the falling rock, seemed
to man to exhibit the same movements. It was quite
natural that primitive man should attribute an independent
life to these &ldquo;dead&rdquo; bodies. He knew no
more of the real sources of movement in the one case
than in the other.</p>

<p>We find the earliest scientific observations on the
nature of man&rsquo;s vital functions (as well as on his structure)
in the Greek natural philosophers and physicians
of the sixth and fifth centuries before Christ. The
best collection of the physiological facts which were
known at that time is to be found in the <i>Natural History</i>
of Aristotle; a great number of his assertions
were probably taken from Democritus and Hippocrates.
The school of the latter had already made attempts to
explain the mystery; it postulated as the ultimate
source of life in man and the beasts a volatile &ldquo;spirit
of life&rdquo; (Pneuma); and Erasistratus (280 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) already
drew a distinction between the lower and the
higher &ldquo;spirit of life,&rdquo; the <i>pneuma zoticon</i> in the heart
and the <i>pneuma psychicon</i> in the brain.</p>

<p>The credit of gathering these scattered truths into
unity, and of making the first attempt at a systematic
physiology, belongs to the great Greek physician
Galen; we have already recognized in him the first
great anatomist of antiquity (cf. <a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>). In his researches
into the organs of the body he never lost sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
of the question of their vital activity, their functions;
and even in this direction he proceeded by the same
comparative method, taking for his principal study
the animals which approach nearest to man. Whatever
he learned from these he applied directly to man.
He recognized the value of physiological experiment;
in his vivisection of apes, dogs, and swine he made a
number of interesting experiments. Vivisection has
been made the object of a violent attack in recent years,
not only by the ignorant and narrow-minded, but by
theological enemies of knowledge and by perfervid
sentimentalists; it is, however, one of the <i>indispensable</i>
methods of research into the nature of life, and has
given us invaluable information on the most important
questions. This was recognized by Galen seventeen
hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Galen reduces all the different functions of the body
to three groups, which correspond to the three forms of
the <i>pneuma</i>, or vital spirit. The <i>pneuma psychicon</i>&mdash;the
soul&mdash;which resides in the brain and nerves, is the
cause of thought, sensation, and will (voluntary movement);
the <i>pneuma zoticon</i>&mdash;the heart&mdash;is responsible
for the beat of the heart, the pulse, and the temperature;
the <i>pneuma physicon</i>, seated in the liver, is the source
of the so-called vegetative functions, digestion and assimilation,
growth and reproduction. He especially
emphasized the renewal of the blood in the lungs, and
expressed a hope that we should some day succeed in
isolating the permanent element in the atmosphere&mdash;the
<i>pneuma</i>, as he calls it&mdash;which is taken into the
blood in respiration. More than fifteen centuries
elapsed before this <i>pneuma</i>&mdash;oxygen&mdash;was discovered
by Lavoisier.</p>

<p>In human physiology, as well as in anatomy, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
great system of Galen was for thirteen centuries the
<i>Codex aureus</i>, the inviolable source of all knowledge.
The influence of Christianity, so fatal to scientific
culture, raised the same insuperable obstacles in this
as in every other branch of secular knowledge. Not a
single scientist appeared from the third to the sixteenth
century who dared to make independent research
into man&rsquo;s vital activity, and transcend the limits of
the Galenic system. It was not until the sixteenth
century that experiments were made in that direction
by a number of distinguished physicians and anatomists
(Paracelsus, Servetus, Vesalius, and others). In
1628 Harvey published his great discovery of the circulation
of the blood, and showed that the heart is a
pump, which drives the red stream unceasingly through
the connected system of arteries and veins by a rhythmic,
unconscious contraction of its muscles. Not less
important were Harvey&rsquo;s researches into the procreation
of animals, as a result of which he formulated the
well-known law: &ldquo;Every living thing comes from an
egg&rdquo; (<i>omne vivum ex ovo</i>).</p>

<p>The powerful impetus which Harvey gave to physiological
observation and experiment led to a great number
of discoveries in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. These were co-ordinated for the first time
by the learned Albrecht Haller about the middle of the
last century; in his great work, <i>Elementa Physiologiae</i>,
he established the inherent importance of the science,
independently of its relation to practical medicine.
In postulating, however, a special &ldquo;sensitive
force or sensibility&rdquo; for neural action, and a special
&ldquo;irritability&rdquo; for muscular movement, Haller gave
strong support to the erroneous idea of a specific &ldquo;vital
force&rdquo; (<i>vis vitalis</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>For more than a century afterwards, from the middle
of the eighteenth until the middle of the nineteenth
century, medicine and (especially) physiology were
dominated by the old idea that a certain number of the
vital processes may be traced to physical and chemical
causes, but that others are the outcome of a special vital
force which is independent of physical agencies. However
much scientists differed in their conceptions of its
nature and its relation to the &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; they were all
agreed as to its independence of, and essential distinction
from, the chemico-physical forces of ordinary &ldquo;matter&rdquo;;
it was a self-contained force (<i>archaeus</i>), unknown
in inorganic nature, which compelled ordinary forces
into its service. Not only the distinctly psychical activity,
the sensibility of the nerves and the irritability of
the muscles, but even the phenomena of sense activity,
of reproduction, and of development seemed so wonderful
and so mysterious in their sources that it was impossible
to attribute them to simple physical and chemical
processes. As the free activity of the vital force
was purposive and conscious, it led, in philosophy, to
a complete <i>teleology</i>; especially did this seem indisputable
when even the &ldquo;critical&rdquo; philosopher Kant
had acknowledged, in his famous critique of the teleological
position, that, though the mind&rsquo;s authority
to give a mechanical interpretation of all phenomena is
theoretically unlimited, yet its actual capacity for such
interpretation does not extend to the phenomena of organic
life; here we are compelled to have recourse to
a <i>purposive</i>&mdash;therefore <i>supernatural</i>&mdash;principle. This
divergence of the <i>vital</i> phenomena from the <i>mechanical</i>
processes of life became, naturally, more conspicuous
as science advanced in the chemical and physical explanation
of the latter. The circulation of the blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and a number of other phenomena could be traced to
mechanical agencies; respiration and digestion were
attributable to chemical processes like those we find
in inorganic nature. On the other hand, it seemed impossible
to do this with the wonderful performances of
the nerves and muscles, and with the characteristic life
of the mind; the co-ordination of all the different forces
in the life of the individual seemed also beyond such a
mechanical interpretation. Hence there arose a complete
physiological dualism&mdash;an essential distinction
was drawn between inorganic and organic nature, between
mechanical and vital processes, between material
force and life force, between the body and the soul. At
the beginning of the nineteenth century this vitalism
was firmly established in France by Louis Dumas,
and in Germany by Reil. Alexander Humboldt had
already published a poetical presentation of it in 1795,
in his narrative of the <i>Legend of Rhodes</i>; it is repeated,
with critical notes, in his <i>Views of Nature</i>.</p>

<p>In the first half of the seventeenth century the famous
philosopher Descartes, starting from Harvey&rsquo;s discovery
of the circulation of the blood, put forward the idea
that the body of man, like that of other animals, is
merely an intricate machine, and that its movements
take place under the same mechanical laws as the
movements of an automaton of human construction.
It is true that Descartes, at the same time, claimed for
man the exclusive possession of a perfectly independent,
immaterial soul, and held that its subjective experience,
thought, was the only thing in the world of
which we have direct and certain cognizance (&ldquo;<i>Cogito,
ergo sum</i>&rdquo;). Yet this dualism did not prevent him
from doing much to advance our knowledge of the mechanical
life processes in detail. Borelli followed (1660)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
with a reduction of the movements of the animal body
to purely physical laws, and Sylvius endeavored, about
the same time, to give a purely chemical explanation of
the phenomena of digestion and respiration; the former
founded the <i>iatromechanical</i>, the latter the <i>iatrochemical</i>,
school of medicine. However, these rational tendencies
towards a natural, mechanical explanation of
the phenomena of life did not attain to a universal acceptance
and application; in the course of the eighteenth
century they fell entirely away before the advance
of teleological vitalism. The final disproof of the latter
and a return to mechanism only became possible with
the happy growth of the new science of comparative
physiology in the forties of the present century.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the vital functions, like our knowledge
of the structure of the human body, was originally
obtained, for the most part, not by direct observation of
the human organism itself, but by a study of the more
closely related animals among the vertebrates, especially
the mammals. In this sense the very earliest
beginning of human anatomy and physiology was
&ldquo;comparative.&rdquo; But the distinct science of &ldquo;comparative
physiology,&rdquo; which embraces the whole sphere of
life phenomena, from the lowest animal up to man, is
a triumph of the nineteenth century. Its famous creator
was Johannes Müller, of Berlin (born, the son of a
shoemaker, at Coblentz, in 1801). For fully twenty-five
years&mdash;from 1833 to 1858&mdash;this most versatile and
most comprehensive biologist of our age evinced an activity
at the Berlin University, as professor and investigator,
which is only comparable with the associated
work of Haller and Cuvier. Nearly every one
of the great biologists who have taught and worked in
Germany for the last sixty years was, directly or in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>directly,
a pupil of Johannes Müller. Starting from the
anatomy and physiology of man, he soon gathered all
the chief groups of the higher and lower animals within
his sphere of comparison. As, moreover, he compared
the structure of extinct animals with the living, and
the healthy organism with the diseased, endeavoring
to bring together all the phenomena of life in a truly
philosophic fashion, he attained a biological knowledge
far in advance of his predecessors.</p>

<p>The most valuable fruit of these comprehensive studies
of Johannes Müller was his <i>Manual of Human Physiology</i>.
This classical work contains much more than
the title indicates; it is the sketch of a comprehensive
&ldquo;comparative biology.&rdquo; It is still unsurpassed in respect
of its contents and range of investigation. In
particular, we find the methods of observation and experiment
applied in it as masterfully as the philosophic
processes of induction and deduction. Müller was originally
a vitalist, like all the physiologists of his time.
Nevertheless, the current idea of a vital force took a
novel form in his speculations, and gradually transformed
itself into the very opposite. For he attempted
to explain the phenomena of life mechanically in every
department of physiology. His &ldquo;transfigured&rdquo; vital
force was not <i>above</i> the physical and chemical laws of
the rest of nature but entirely bound up with them. It
was, in a word, nothing more than life itself&mdash;that is,
the sum of all the movements which we perceive in the
living organism. He sought especially to give them
the same mechanical interpretation in the life of the
senses and of the mind as in the working of the muscles;
the same in the phenomena of circulation, respiration,
and digestion as in generation and development.
Müller&rsquo;s success was chiefly due to the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
that he always began with the simplest life phenomena
of the lowest animals, and followed them step by step
in their gradual development up to the very highest, to
man. In this his method of <i>critical comparison</i> proved
its value both from the physiological and from the anatomical
point of view. Johannes Müller is, moreover,
the only great scientist who has equally cultivated
these two branches of research, and combined them
with equal brilliancy. Immediately after his death
his vast scientific kingdom fell into four distinct provinces,
which are now nearly always represented by
four or more chairs&mdash;human and comparative anatomy,
pathological anatomy, physiology, and the history
of evolution. This sudden division of Müller&rsquo;s
immense realm of learning in 1858 has been compared
to the dissolution of the empire which Alexander the
Great had consolidated and ruled.</p>

<p>Among the many pupils of Johannes Müller who,
either during his lifetime or after his death, labored
hard for the advancement of the various branches of
biology, one of the most fortunate&mdash;if not the most important&mdash;was
Theodor Schwann. When the able botanist
Schleiden, in 1838, indicated the cell as the common
elementary organ of all plants, and proved that
all the different tissues of the plant are merely combinations
of cells, Johannes Müller recognized at once the
extraordinary possibilities of this important discovery.
He himself sought to point out the same composition
in various tissues of the animal body&mdash;for instance, in
the spinal cord of vertebrates&mdash;and thus led his pupil,
Schwann, to extend the discovery to all the animal tissues.
This difficult task was accomplished by Schwann
in his <i>Microscopic Researches into the Accordance in
the Structure and Growth of Plants and Animals</i> (1839).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Thus was the foundation laid of the &ldquo;cellular theory,&rdquo;
the profound importance of which, both in physiology
and anatomy, has become clearer and more widely
recognized in each subsequent year. Moreover, it was
shown by two other pupils of Johannes Müller that the
activity of all organisms is, in the ultimate analysis,
the activity of the components of their tissues, the microscopic
cells&mdash;these were the able physiologist Ernst
Brücke, of Vienna, and the distinguished histologist
Albert Kölliker, of Würzburg. Brücke correctly denominated
the cells the &ldquo;elementary organisms,&rdquo; and
showed that, in the body of man and of all other animals,
they are the only actual, independent factors of
the life process. Kölliker earned special distinction,
not only in the construction of the whole science of
histology, but particularly by showing that the animal
ovum and its products are simple cells.</p>

<p>Still, however widely the immense importance of the
cellular theory for all biological research was acknowledged,
the &ldquo;cellular physiology&rdquo; which is based on it
only began an independent development very recently.
In this Max Verworn (of Jena) earned a twofold distinction.
In his <i>Psycho-physiological Studies of the
Protistae</i> (1889) he showed, as a result of an ingenious
series of experimental researches, that the &ldquo;theory of
a cell-soul&rdquo; which I put forward in 1866<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is completely
established by an accurate study of the unicellular protozoa,
and that &ldquo;the psychic phenomena of the protistæ
form the bridge which unites the chemical processes
of inorganic nature with the mental life of the
highest animals.&rdquo; Verworn has further developed
these views, and based them on the modern theory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
evolution, in his <i>General Physiology</i>. This distinguished
work returns to the comprehensive point of
view of Johannes Müller, in opposition to the one-sided
and narrow methods of those modern physiologists
who think to discover the nature of the vital phenomena
by the exclusive aid of chemical and physical
experiments. Verworn showed that it is only by Müller&rsquo;s
comparative method and by a profound study of
the physiology of the cell that we can reach the higher
stand-point which will give us a comprehensive survey
of the wonderful realm of the phenomena of life. Only
thus do we become convinced that the vital processes in
man are subject to the same physical and chemical
laws as those of all other animals.</p>

<p>The fundamental importance of the cellular theory
for all branches of biology was made clear in the second
half of the nineteenth century, not only by the rapid
progress of morphology and physiology, but also by
the entire reform of that biological science which has
always been deemed most important on account of its
relation to practical medicine&mdash;pathology, or the science
of disease. Many even of the older physicians
were convinced that human diseases were natural phenomena,
like all other manifestations of life, and should
be studied scientifically, like other vital functions. Particular
schools of medicine&mdash;the Iatrophysical and the
Iatrochemical&mdash;had already, in the seventeenth century,
attempted to trace the sources of disease to certain
physical and chemical changes. However, the imperfect
condition of science at that period precluded any
lasting results of these efforts. Many of the older
theories, which sought the nature of disease in supernatural
and mystical causes, were almost universally
accepted down to the middle of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>It was then that Rudolf Virchow, another pupil of
Müller, conceived the happy idea of transferring the
cellular theory from the healthy to the diseased organism;
he sought in the more minute metamorphoses of
the diseased cells and the tissues they composed the
true source of those larger changes which, in the form
of disease, threaten the living organism with peril and
death. Especially during the seven years of his professorship
at Würzburg (1849-56) Virchow pursued his
great task with such brilliant results that his <i>Cellular
Pathology</i> (published in 1858) turned, at one stroke, the
whole of pathology and the dependent science of practical
medicine into new and eminently fruitful paths.
This reform of medicine is significant for our present
purpose in that it led us to a monistic and purely scientific
conception of disease. In sickness, no less than
in health, man is subject to the same eternal &ldquo;iron
laws&rdquo; of physics and chemistry as all the rest of the
organic world.</p>

<p>Among the numerous classes of animals which
modern zoology distinguishes the mammals occupy
a pre-eminent position, not only on morphological
grounds, but also for physiological reasons. As man
belongs to the class of mammals (see <a href="#Page_27">p. 27</a>) by every portion
of his frame, we must expect him to share his
characteristic functions with the rest of the mammals.
Such we find to be the case. The circulation of the
blood and respiration are accomplished in man under
precisely the same laws and in the same manner as in
all the other mammals&mdash;<i>and in these alone</i>; they are
determined by the peculiar structure of their heart and
lungs. In mammals only is all the arterial blood conducted
from the left ventricle of the heart to the body
by one, the <i>left</i>, branch of the aorta, while in birds it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
passes along the <i>right</i> branch, and in reptiles along
both branches. The blood of mammals is distinguished
from that of any other vertebrate by the circumstance
that its red cells have lost their nucleus (by
reversion). The respiratory movements are effected
largely by the diaphragm in this class of animals
alone, because only in them does it form a complete
partition between the pectoral and abdominal cavities.
Special importance, however, in this highest class of
animals, attaches to the production of milk in the
breasts (<i>mammae</i>), and to the peculiar method of the
rearing of the young, which entails the supplying of
the offspring with the mother&rsquo;s milk. As this nutritive
process reacts most powerfully on the other vital
functions, and the maternal affection of mammals
must have arisen from this intimate form of
rearing, the name of the class justly reminds us of its
great importance. In millions of pictures, most of
them produced by painters of the highest rank, the
&ldquo;madonna with the child&rdquo; is revered as the purest
and noblest type of maternal love&mdash;the instinct which
is found in its extreme form in the exaggerated tenderness
of the mother-ape.</p>

<p>As the apes approach nearest to man of all the mammals
in point of structure, we shall expect to hear the
same of their vital functions; and that we find to be
the case. Everybody knows how closely the habits,
the movements, the sense activity, the mental life, and
the parental customs of apes resemble those of man.
Scientific physiology proves the same significant resemblance
in other less familiar processes, particularly
in the working of the heart, the division of the breasts,
and the sexual life. In the latter connection it is especially
noteworthy that the mature females of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
kinds of apes suffer a periodical discharge of blood
from the womb, which corresponds to the menstruation
of the human female. The secretion of the milk
in the glands and the suctorial process also take place
in the female ape in precisely the same fashion as in
women.</p>

<p>Finally, it is of especial interest that the speech of
apes seems on physiological comparison to be a stage
in the formation of articulate human speech. Among
living apes there is an Indian species which is musical;
the <i>hylobates syndactylus</i> sings a full octave in perfectly
pure, harmonious half-tones. No impartial
philologist can hesitate any longer to admit that our
elaborate rational language has been slowly and
gradually developed out of the imperfect speech of
our Pliocene simian ancestors.</p>

<p>Comparative ontogeny, or the science of the development
of the individual animal, is a child of
the nineteenth century in even a truer sense than comparative
anatomy and physiology. How is the child
formed in the mother&rsquo;s womb? How do animals
evolve from ova? How does the plant come forth
from the seed? These pregnant questions have occupied
the thoughtful mind for thousands of years.
Yet it is only seventy years since the embryologist
Baer pointed out the correct means and methods for
penetrating into the mysteries of embryonic life; it is
only forty years since Darwin, by his reform of the
theory of descent, gave us the key which should open
the long-closed door, and lead to a knowledge of em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>bryonic
agencies. As I have endeavored to give a
complete, popular presentation of this very interesting
but difficult study in the first section of my <i>Anthropogeny</i>,
I will confine myself here to a brief survey
and discussion of the most important phenomena. Let
us first cast a historical glance at the older ontogeny,
and the theory of preformation which is connected
with it.</p>

<p>The classical works of Aristotle, the many-sided
&ldquo;father of science,&rdquo; are the oldest known scientific
sources of embryology, as we found them to be for
comparative anatomy. Not only in his great natural
history, but also in a special small work, <i>Five Books
on the Generation and Development of Animals</i>, the
great philosopher gives us a host of interesting facts,
adding many observations on their significance; it
was not until our own days that many of them were
fully appreciated, and, indeed, we may say, discovered
afresh. Naturally, many fables and errors are mixed
up with them; it was all that was known at that time
of the hidden growth of the human germ. Yet during
the long space of the next two thousand years the
slumbering science made no further progress. It was
not until the commencement of the seventeenth century
that there was a renewal of activity. In 1600 the
Italian anatomist Fabricius ab Aquapendente published
at Padua the first pictures and descriptions of
the embryos of man and some of the higher animals;
in 1687 the famous Marcello Malpighi, of Bologna, a
distinguished pioneer alike in zoology and botany,
published the first consistent exposition of the growth
of the chick in the hatched egg.</p>

<p>All these older scientists were possessed with the
idea that the complete body, with all its parts, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
already contained in the ovum of animals, only it was
so minute and transparent that it could not be detected;
that, therefore, the whole development was nothing
more than a <i>growth</i>, or an &ldquo;unfolding,&rdquo; of the parts
that were already &ldquo;infolded&rdquo; (<i>involutae</i>). This erroneous
notion, almost universally accepted until the beginning
of the present century, is called the &ldquo;preformation
theory&rdquo;; sometimes it is called the &ldquo;evolution theory&rdquo;
(in the literal sense of &ldquo;unfolding&rdquo;); but the
latter title is accepted by modern scientists for the very
different theory of &ldquo;transformation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Closely connected with the preformation theory, and
as a logical consequence of it, there arose in the last
century a further theory which keenly interested all
thoughtful biologists&mdash;the curious &ldquo;theory of scatulation.&rdquo;
As it was thought that the outline of the entire
organism, with all its parts, was present in the egg,
the ovary of the embryo had to be supposed to contain
the ova of the following generation; these, again, the ova
of the next, and so on <i>in infinitum</i>! On that basis the
distinguished physiologist Haller calculated that God
had created together, 6000 years ago&mdash;on the sixth day
of his creatorial labors&mdash;the germs of 200,000,000,000
men, and ingeniously packed them all in the ovary of
our venerable mother Eve. Even the gifted philosopher
Leibnitz fully accepted this conclusion, and embodied
it in his monadist theory; and as, on his theory,
soul and body are in eternal, inseparable companionship,
the consequence had to be accepted for the soul;
&ldquo;the souls of men have existed in organized bodies in
their ancestors from Adam downward&mdash;that is, from
the very beginning of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the month of November, 1759, a young doctor of
twenty-six years, Caspar Friedrich Wolff (son of a Berlin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
tailor), published his dissertation for the degree at Halle,
under the title, <i>Theoria Generationis</i>. Supported by a
series of most laborious and painstaking observations,
he proved the entire falsity of the dominant theories
of preformation and scatulation. In the hatched egg
there is at first no trace of the coming chick and its organs;
instead of it we find on top of the yolk a small,
circular, white disk. This thin &ldquo;germinal disk&rdquo; becomes
gradually round, and then breaks up into four
folds, lying upon each other, which are the rudiments
of the four chief systems of organs&mdash;the nervous system
above, the muscular system underneath, the vascular
system (with the heart), and, finally, the alimentary
canal. Thus, as Wolff justly remarked, the
embryonic development does not consist in an unfolding
of the preformed organs, but in a series of new constructions;
it is a true <i>epigenesis</i>. One part arises after
another, and all make their appearance in a simple
form, which is very different from the later structure.
This only appears after a series of most remarkable
formations. Although this great discovery&mdash;one of
the most important of the eighteenth century&mdash;could
be directly proved by a verification of the facts Wolff
had observed, and although the &ldquo;theory of generation&rdquo;
which was founded on it was in reality not a theory
at all, but a simple fact, it met with no sympathy
whatever for half a century. It was particularly retarded
by the high authority of Haller, who fought it
strenuously with the dogmatic assertion that &ldquo;there is
no such thing as development: no part of the animal
body is formed before another; all were created together.&rdquo;
Wolff, who had to go to St. Petersburg, was
long in his grave before the forgotten facts he had observed
were discovered afresh by Oken at Jena, in 1806.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>After Wolff&rsquo;s &ldquo;epigenesis theory&rdquo; had been established
by Oken and Neckel (whose important work on
the development of the alimentary canal was translated
from Latin into German), a number of young German
scientists devoted themselves eagerly to more accurate
embryological research. The most important and successful
of these was Carl Ernst Baer. His principal
work appeared in 1828, with the title, <i>History of the
Development of Animals: Observations and Reflections</i>.
Not only the phenomena of the formation of the germ
are clearly illustrated and fully described in it, but it
adds a number of very pregnant speculations. In particular,
the form of the embryo of man and the mammals
is correctly presented, and the vastly different development
of the lower invertebrate animals is also considered.
The two leaflike layers which appear in the
round germ disk of the higher vertebrates first divide,
according to Baer, into two further layers, and these
four germinal layers are transformed into four tubes,
which represent the fundamental organs&mdash;the skin
layer, the muscular layer, the vascular layer, and the
mucous layer. Then, by very complicated evolutionary
processes, the later organs arise, in substantially
the same manner, in man and all the other vertebrates.
The three chief groups of invertebrates, which in their
turn differ widely from each other, have a very different
development.</p>

<p>One of the most important of Baer&rsquo;s many discoveries
was the finding of the human ovum. Up to that
time the little vesicles which are found in great numbers
in the human ovary and in that of all other mammals
had been taken for the ova. Baer was the first
to prove, in 1827, that the real ova are enclosed in these
vesicles&mdash;the &ldquo;Graafian follicles&rdquo;&mdash;and much smaller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
being tiny spheres 1-120th inch in diameter, visible to
the naked eye as minute specks under favorable conditions.
He discovered likewise that from this tiny
ovum of the mammal there develops first a characteristic
germ globule, a hollow sphere with liquid contents,
the wall of which forms the slender germinal membrane,
or blastoderm.</p>

<p>Ten years after Baer had given a firm foundation to
embryological science by his theory of germ layers a
new task confronted it on the establishment of the cellular
theory in 1838. What is the relation of the ovum
and the layers which arise from it to the tissues and
cells which compose the fully developed organism? The
correct answer to this difficult question was given about
the middle of this century by two distinguished pupils
of Johannes Müller&mdash;Robert Remak, of Berlin, and
Albert Kölliker, of Würzburg. They showed that the
ovum is at first one simple cell, and that the many germinal
globules, or granules, which arise from it by repeated
segmentation, are also simple cells. From this
mulberry-like group of cells are constructed first the
germinal layers, and subsequently by differentiation,
or division of labor, all the different organs. Kölliker
has the further merit of showing that the seminal fluid
of male animals is also a mass of microscopic cells.
The active pin-shaped &ldquo;seed-animalcules,&rdquo; or <i>spermatozoa</i>,
in it are merely ciliated cells, as I first proved in
the case of the seed-filaments of the sponge in 1866.
Thus it was proved that both the materials of generation,
the male sperm and the female ova, fell in with the
cellular theory. That was a discovery of which the
great philosophic significance was not appreciated until
a much later date, on a close study of the phenomena
of conception in 1875.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>All the older studies in embryonic development concern
man and the higher vertebrates, especially the embryonic
bird, since hens&rsquo; eggs are the largest and most
convenient objects for investigation, and are plentiful
enough to facilitate experiment; we can hatch them
in the incubator, as well as by the natural function of
the hen, and so observe from hour to hour, during the
space of three weeks, the whole series of formations,
from the simple germ cell to the complete organism.
Even Baer had only been able to gather from such observations
the fact that the different classes of vertebrates
agreed in the characteristic form of the germ
layers and the growth of particular organs. In the
innumerable classes of invertebrates, on the other hand&mdash;that
is, in the great majority of animals&mdash;the embryonic
development seemed to run quite a different course,
and most of them seemed to be altogether without true
germinal layers. It was not until about the middle of
the century that such layers were found in some of the
invertebrates. Huxley, for instance, found them in the
medusæ in 1849, and Kölliker in the cephalopods in
1844. Particularly important was the discovery of
Kowalewsky (1886) that the lowest vertebrate&mdash;the lancelot,
or amphioxus&mdash;is developed in just the same manner
(and a very original fashion it is) as an invertebrate,
apparently quite remote, tunicate, the sea-squirt,
or ascidian. Even in some of the worms, the radiata
and the articulata, a similar formation of the germinal
layers was pointed out by the same observer. I myself
was then (since 1886) occupied with the embryology of
the sponges, corals, medusæ, and siphonophoræ, and,
as I found the same formation of two primary germ
layers everywhere in these lowest classes of multicellular
animals, I came to the conclusion that this impor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>tant
embryonic feature is common to the entire animal
world. The circumstance that in the sponges and the
cnidaria (polyps, medusæ, etc.) the body consists for a
long time, sometimes throughout life, merely of two
simple layers of cells, seemed to me especially significant.
Huxley had already (1849) compared these, in
the case of the medusæ, with the two primary germinal
layers of the vertebrates. On the ground of these observations
and comparisons I then, in 1872, in my <i>Philosophy
of the Calcispongiae</i>, published the &ldquo;theory of
the gastræa,&rdquo; of which the following are the essential
points:</p>

<p>I. The whole animal world falls into two essentially
different groups, the unicellular primitive animals (Protozoa)
and the multicellular animals with complex tissues
(Metazoa). The entire organism of the protozoon
(the rhizopods of the infusoria) remains throughout life
a single simple cell (or occasionally a loose colony of
cells without the formation of tissue, a <i>coenobium</i>). The
organism of the metazoon, on the contrary, is only unicellular
at the commencement, and is subsequently
built up of a number of cells which form tissues.</p>

<p>II. Hence the method of reproduction and development
is very different in each of these great categories
of animals. The protozoa usually multiply by <i>non-sexual</i>
means, by fission, gemmation, or spores; they
have no real ova and no sperm. The metazoa, on the
contrary, are divided into male and female sexes, and
generally propagate sexually, by means of true ova,
which are fertilized by the male sperm.</p>

<p>III. Hence, further, true germinal layers, and the
tissues which are formed from them, are found only
in the metazoa; they are entirely wanting in the protozoa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>IV. In all the metazoa only two primary layers appear
at first, and these have always the same essential
significance; from the <i>outer</i> layer the external skin and
the nervous system are developed; from the <i>inner</i> layer
are formed the alimentary canal and all the other organs.</p>

<p>V. I called the germ, which always arises first from
the impregnated ovum, and which consists of these two
primary layers, the &ldquo;gut-larva,&rdquo; or the <i>gastrula</i>; its
cup-shaped body with the two layers encloses originally
a simple digestive cavity, the primitive gut (the
<i>progaster</i> or <i>archenteron</i>), and its simple opening is the
primitive mouth (the <i>prostoma</i> or <i>blastoporus</i>). These
are the earliest organs of the multicellular body, and
the two cell layers of its enclosing wall, simple epithelia,
are its earliest tissues; all the other organs and tissues
are a later and secondary growth from these.</p>

<p>VI. From this similarity, or <i>homology</i>, of the gastrula
in all classes of compound animals I drew the conclusion,
in virtue of the biogenetic law (<a href="#Page_81">p. 81</a>), that all
the metazoa come originally from one simple ancestral
form, the <i>gastraea</i>, and that this ancient (Laurentian),
long-extinct form had the structure and composition of
the actual gastrula, in which it is preserved by heredity.</p>

<p>VII. This phylogenetic conclusion, based on the
comparison of ontogenetic facts, is confirmed by the
circumstance that there are several of these gastræades
still in existence (<i>gastraemaria</i>, <i>cyemaria</i>, <i>physemaria</i>,
etc.), and also some ancient forms of other animal
groups whose organization is very little higher (the
<i>olynthus</i> of the sponges, the <i>hydra</i>, or common fresh-water
polyp, of the cnidaria, the <i>convoluta</i> and other
cryptocæla, or worms of the simplest type, of the <i>platodes</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>VIII. In the further development of the various
tissue-forming animals from the gastrula we have to
distinguish two principal groups. The earlier and
<i>lower</i> types (the <i>coelenteria</i> or <i>acoelomia</i>) have no body
cavity, no vent, and no blood; such is the case with
the gastræades, sponges, cnidaria, and platodes. The
later and <i>higher</i> types (the <i>caelomaria</i> or <i>bilateria</i>), on
the other hand, have a true body cavity, and generally
blood and a vent; to these we must refer the worms
and the higher types of animals which were evolved
from these later on, the echinodermata, mollusca, articulata,
tunicata, and vertebrata.</p>

<p>Those are the main points of my &ldquo;gastræa theory&rdquo;;
I have since enlarged the first sketch of it (given in
1872), and have endeavored to substantiate it in a series
of &ldquo;Studies on the gastræa theory&rdquo; (1873-84). Although
it was almost universally rejected at first, and
fiercely combated for ten years by many authorities,
it is now (and has been for the last fifteen years) accepted
by nearly all my colleagues. Let us now see
what far-reaching consequences follow from it, and
from the evolution of the germ, especially with regard
to our great question, &ldquo;the place of man in nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The human ovum, like that of all other animals, is
a single cell, and this tiny globular egg cell (about the
120th of an inch in diameter) has just the same characteristic
appearance as that of all other viviparous organisms.
The little ball of protoplasm is surrounded
by a thick, transparent, finely reticulated membrane,
called the <i>zona pellucida</i>; even the little, globular,
germinal vesicle (the cell-nucleus), which is enclosed
in the protoplasm (the cell-body), is of the same size
and the same qualities as in the rest of the mammals.
The same applies to the active spermatozoa of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
male, the minute, threadlike, ciliated cells of which
millions are found in every drop of the seminal fluid;
on account of their lifelike movements they were previously
taken to be forms of life, as the name indicates
(spermatozoa&mdash;sperm animals). Moreover, the origin
of both these important sexual cells in their respective
organs is the same in man as in the other
mammals; both the ova in the ovary of the female and
the spermatozoa in the spermarium of the male arise
in the same fashion&mdash;they always come from cells,
which are originally derived from the c&oelig;lous epithelium,
the layer of cells which clothes the cavity of the
body.</p>

<p>The most important moment in the life of every man,
as in that of all other complex animals, is the moment
in which he begins his individual existence; it is the
moment when the sexual cells of both parents meet
and coalesce for the formation of a single simple cell.
This new cell, the impregnated egg cell, is the individual
stem cell (the <i>cytula</i>), the continued segmentation
of which produces the cells of the germinal layers
and the gastrula. With the formation of this cytula,
hence in the process of conception itself, the existence
of the personality, the independent individual, commences.
This ontogenic fact is supremely important,
for the most far-reaching conclusions may be drawn
from it. In the first place, we have a clear perception
that man, like all the other complex animals, inherits
all his personal characteristics, bodily and mental,
from his parents; and, further, we come to the momentous
conclusion that the new personality which
arises thus can lay no claim to &ldquo;immortality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hence the minute processes of conception and sexual
generation are of the first importance. We are, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>ever,
only familiar with their details since 1875, when
Oscar Hertwig, my pupil and fellow-traveller at that
time, began his researches into the impregnation of the
egg of the sea-urchin at Ajaccio, in Corsica. The
beautiful capital of the island in which Napoleon the
Great was born, in 1769, was also the spot in which the
mysteries of animal conception were carefully studied
for the first time in their most important aspects. Hertwig
found that the one essential element in conception
is the coalescence of the two sexual cells and their nuclei.
Only one out of the millions of male ciliated cells
which press round the ovum penetrates to its nucleus.
The nuclei of both cells, of the spermatozoon and of
the ovum, drawn together by a mysterious force, which
we take to be a chemical sense-activity, related to smell,
approach each other and melt into one. Thus, by the
sensitive perception of the sexual nuclei, following
upon a kind of &ldquo;erotic chemicotropism,&rdquo; a new cell is
formed, which unites in itself the inherited qualities of
both parents; the nucleus of the spermatozoon conveys
the paternal features, the nucleus of the ovum
those of the mother, to the stem cell, from which the
child is to be developed. That applies both to the bodily
and to the mental characteristics.</p>

<p>The formation of the germinal layers by the repeated
division of the stem cell, the growth of the gastrula
and of the later germ structures which succeed it, take
place in man in just the same manner as in the other
higher mammals, under the peculiar conditions which
differentiate this group from the lower vertebrates. In
the earlier stages of development these special characters
of the placentalia are not to be detected. The significant
embryonic or larval form of the chordula,
which succeeds the gastrula, has substantially the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
same structure in all vertebrates; a simple straight
rod, the dorsal cord, lies lengthways along the main
axis of the shield-shaped body&mdash;the &ldquo;embryonic shield&rdquo;;
above the cord the spinal marrow develops out of the
outer germinal layer, while the gut makes its appearance
underneath. Then, on both sides, to the right
and left of the axial rod, appear the segments of the
&ldquo;pro-vertebræ&rdquo; and the outlines of the muscular plates,
with which the formation of the members of the vertebrate
body begins. The gill-clefts appear on either
side of the fore-gut; they are the openings of the
gullet, through which, in our primitive fish-ancestors,
the water which had entered at the mouth for breathing
purposes made its exit at the sides of the head. By
a tenacious heredity these gill-clefts, which have no
meaning except for our fish-like aquatic ancestors, are
still preserved in the embryo of man and all the other
vertebrates. They disappear after a time. Even after
the five vesicles of the embryonic brain appear in the
head, and the rudiments of the eyes and ears at the
sides, and after the legs sprout out at the base of the
fish-like embryo, in the form of two roundish, flat buds,
the f&oelig;tus is still so like that of other vertebrates that
it is indistinguishable from them.</p>

<p>The substantial similarity in outer form and inner
structure which characterizes the embryo of man and
other vertebrates in this early stage of development is
an embryological fact of the first importance; from it,
by the fundamental law of biogeny, we may draw the
most momentous conclusions. There is but one explanation
of it&mdash;heredity from a common parent form.
When we see that, at a certain stage, the embryos of
man and the ape, the dog and the rabbit, the pig and
the sheep, although recognizable as higher vertebrates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
cannot be distinguished from each other, the fact can
only be elucidated by assuming a common parentage.
And this explanation is strengthened when we follow
the subsequent divergence of these embryonic forms.
The nearer two animals are in their bodily structure,
and, therefore, in the scheme of nature, so much the
longer do we find their embryos to retain this resemblance,
and so much the closer do they approach each
other in the ancestral tree of their respective group, so
much the closer is their genetic relationship. Hence it
is that the embryos of man and the anthropoid ape retain
the resemblance much later, at an advanced stage
of development, when their distinction from the embryos
of other mammals can be seen at a glance. I have
illustrated this significant fact by a juxtaposition of
corresponding stages in the development of a number
of different vertebrates in my <i>Natural History of Creation</i>
and in my <i>Anthropogeny</i>.</p>

<p>The great phylogenetic significance of the resemblance
we have described is seen, not only in the comparison
of the embryos of vertebrates, but also in the
comparison of their protective membranes. All vertebrates
of the three higher classes&mdash;reptiles, birds, and
mammals&mdash;are distinguished from the lower classes
by the possession of certain special f&oelig;ig;tal membranes,
the amnion and the serolemma. The embryo is enclosed
in these membranes, or bags, which are full of
water, and is thus protected from pressure or shock.
This provident arrangement probably arose during the
Permian period, when the oldest reptiles, the <i>proreptilia</i>,
the common ancestors of all the amniotes (animals
with an <i>amnion</i>), completely adapted themselves to a
life on land. Their direct ancestors, the amphibia, and
the fishes are devoid of these f&oelig;tal membranes; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
would have been superfluous to these inhabitants of
the water. With the inheritance of these protective
coverings are closely connected two other changes in
the amniotes: firstly, the entire disappearance of the
gills (while the gill arches and clefts continue to be inherited
as &ldquo;rudimentary organs&rdquo;); secondly, the construction
of the <i>allantois</i>. This vesicular bag, filled
with water, grows out of the hind-gut in the embryo of
all the amniotes, and is nothing else than an enlargement
of the bladder of their amphibious ancestors.
From its innermost and inferior section is formed subsequently
the permanent bladder of the amniotes, while
the larger outer part shrivels up. Usually this has an
important part to play for a long time as the respiratory
organ of the embryo, a number of large blood-vessels
spreading out over its inner surface. The formation
of the membranes, the amnion and the serolemma, and
of the allantois, is just the same, and is effected by the
same complicated process of growth, in man as in all
the other amniotes; <i>man is a true amniote</i>.</p>

<p>The nourishment of the f&oelig;tus in the maternal womb
is effected, as is well known, by a peculiar organ, richly
supplied with blood at its surface, called the <i>placenta</i>.
This important nutritive organ is a spongy, round disk,
from six to eight inches in diameter, about an inch thick,
and one or two pounds in weight; it is separated after
the birth of the child, and issues as the &ldquo;after-birth.&rdquo;
The placenta consists of two very different parts, the
f&oelig;tal and the maternal part. The latter contains highly
developed sinuses, which retain the blood conveyed
to them by the arteries of the mother. On the other
hand, the f&oelig;tal placenta is formed by innumerable
branching tufts or villi, which grow out of the outer surface
of the allantois, and derive their blood from the um<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>bilical
vessels. The hollow, blood-filled villi of the
f&oelig;tal placenta protrude into the sinuses of the maternal
placenta, and the slender membrane between the two
is so attenuated that it offers no impediment to the direct
interchange of material through the nutritive blood-stream
(by osmosis).</p>

<p>In the older and lower groups of the placentals the
entire surface of the chorion is covered with a number
of short villi; these &ldquo;chorion-villi&rdquo; take the form of
pit-like depressions of the mucous membrane of the
mother, and are easily detached at birth. That happens
in most of the ungulata (the sow, camel, mare,
etc.), the cetacea, and the prosimiæ; these &ldquo;mallo-placentalia&rdquo;
(with a <i>diffuse</i> placenta) have been denominated
the <i>indeciduata</i>. The same formation is
present in man and the other placentals in the beginning.
It is soon modified, however, as the villi on one
part of the chorion are withdrawn; while on the other
part they grow proportionately stronger, and unite intimately
with the mucous membrane of the womb. It
is in consequence of this intimate blending that a portion
of the uterus is detached at birth, and carried away
with loss of blood. This detachable membrane&mdash;the
<i>decidua</i>&mdash;is a characteristic of the higher placentalia,
which have, consequently, been grouped under the title
of <i>deciduata</i>; to that category belong the carnassia,
rodentia, simiæ, and man. In the carnassia and some
of the ungulata (the elephant, for instance) the placenta
takes the form of a girdle, hence they are known as the
<i>zonoplacentalia</i>; in the rodentia, the insectivora (the
mole and the hedge-hog), the apes, and man, it takes
the form of a disk.</p>

<p>Even ten years ago the majority of embryologists
thought that man was distinguished by certain pecu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>liarities
in the form of the placenta&mdash;namely, by the possession
of what is called the <i>decidua reflexa</i>, and by a
special formation of the umbilical chord which unites
the <i>decidua</i> to the f&oelig;tus. It was supposed that the
rest of the placentals, including the apes, were without
these special embryonic structures. The <i>funiculus
umbilicalis</i> is a smooth, cylindrical cord, from sixteen
to twenty-three inches long, and as thick as the little
finger. It forms the connecting link between the f&oelig;tus
and the maternal placenta, since it conducts the nutritive
vessels from the body of the f&oelig;tus to the placenta;
it comprises, besides, the pedicle of the allantois and
the yelk-sac. The yelk-sac in the human case forms
the greater portion of the germinal vesicle during the
third week of gestation; but it shrivels up afterwards
so that it was formerly entirely missed in the mature
f&oelig;tus. Yet it remains all the time in a rudimentary
condition, and may be detected even after birth as the
little umbilical vesicle. Moreover, even the vesicular
structure of the allantois disappears at an early stage
in the human case; with a deflection of the amnion,
it gives rise to the pedicle. We cannot enter here into
a discussion of the complicated anatomical and embryological
relations of these structures. I have described
and illustrated them in my <i>Anthropogeny</i> (twenty-third
chapter).</p>

<p>The opponents of evolution still appealed to these
&ldquo;special features&rdquo; of human embryology, which were
supposed to distinguish man from all the other mammals,
even so late as ten years ago. But in 1890 Emil
Selenka proved that the same features are found in the
anthropoid apes, especially in the orang (<i>satyrus</i>), while
the lower apes are without them. Thus Huxley&rsquo;s pithecometra
thesis was substantiated once more: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>&ldquo;The
differences between man and the great apes are not so
great as are those between the manlike apes and the
lower monkeys.&rdquo; The supposed &ldquo;evidences <i>against</i> the
near blood-relationship of man and the apes&rdquo; proved,
on a closer examination of the real circumstances, to
be strong reasons in favor of it.</p>

<p>Every scientist who penetrates with open eyes into
this dark but profoundly interesting labyrinth of our
embryonic development, and who is competent to compare
it critically with that of the rest of the mammals,
will find in it a most important aid towards the elucidation
of the descent of our species. For the various
stages of our embryonic development, in the character
of <i>palingenetic</i> phenomena of heredity, cast a brilliant
light on the corresponding stages of our ancestral tree,
in accordance with the great law of biogeny. But even
the <i>cenogenetic</i> phenomena of adaptation, the formation
of the temporary f&oelig;tal organs&mdash;the characteristic f&oelig;tal
membranes, and especially the placenta&mdash;gives us sufficiently
definite indications of our <i>close genetic relationship
with the primates</i>.</p>

<p>The youngest of the great branches of the living tree
of biology is the science we call biological evolution,
or <i>phylogeny</i>. It came into existence much later,
and under much more difficult circumstances, than its
natural sister, embryonic evolution or <i>ontogeny</i>. The
object of the latter was to attain a knowledge of the
mysterious processes by which the individual organism,
plant or animal, developed from the egg. Phylogeny
has to answer the much more obscure and
difficult question: &ldquo;What is the origin of the different
organic species of plants and animals?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ontogeny (embryology and metamorphism) could
follow the empirical method of direct observation in the
solution of its not remote problem; it needed but to follow,
day by day and hour by hour, the visible changes
which the f&oelig;tus experiences during a brief period in
the course of its development from the ovum. Much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
more difficult was the remote problem of phylogeny;
for the slow processes of gradual construction, which
effect the rise of new species of animals and plants, go
on imperceptibly during thousands and even millions
of years. Their direct observation is possible only
within very narrow limits; the vast majority of these
historical processes can only be known by direct inference&mdash;by
critical reflection, and by a comparative
use of empirical sciences which belong to very different
fields of thought, palæontology, ontogeny, and morphology.
To this we must add the immense opposition
which was everywhere made to biological evolution on
account of the close connection between questions of
organic creation and supernatural myths and religious
dogmas. For these reasons it can easily be understood
how it is that the scientific existence of a true theory
of origins was only secured, amid fierce controversy,
in the course of the last forty years.</p>

<p>Every serious attempt that was made before the beginning
of the nineteenth century to solve the problem
of the origin of species lost its way in the mythological
labyrinth of the supernatural stories of creation. The
efforts of a few distinguished thinkers to emancipate
themselves from this tyranny and attain to a naturalistic
interpretation proved unavailing. A great variety
of creation myths arose in connection with their religion
in all the ancient civilized nations. During the
Middle Ages triumphant Christendom naturally arrogated
to itself the sole right of pronouncing on the question;
and, the Bible being the basis of the structure
of the Christian religion, the whole story of creation
was taken from the book of Genesis. Even Carl Linné,
the famous Swedish scientist, started from that basis
when, in 1735, in his classical <i>Systema Naturae</i>, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
made the first attempt at a systematic arrangement,
nomenclature, and classification of the innumerable
objects in nature. As the best practical aid in that attempt
he introduced the well-known double or binary
nomenclature; to each kind of animals and plants he
gave a particular specific name, and added to it the
wider-reaching name of the genus. A <i>genus</i> served
to unite the nearest related <i>species</i>; thus, for instance,
Linné grouped under the genus &ldquo;dog&rdquo; (<i>canis</i>), as different
species, the house-dog (<i>canis familiaris</i>), the
jackal (<i>canis aureus</i>), the wolf (<i>canis lupus</i>) the fox
(<i>canis vulpes</i>), etc. This binary nomenclature immediately
proved of such great practical assistance that
it was universally accepted, and is still always followed
in zoological and botanical classification.</p>

<p>But the theoretical dogma which Linné himself connected
with his practical idea of species was fraught
with the gravest peril to science. The first question
which forced itself on the mind of the thoughtful scientist
was the question as to the nature of the concept
of species, its contents, and its range. And the creator
of the idea answered this fundamental question by a
naïve appeal to the dominant Mosaic legend of creation:
&ldquo;<i>Species tot sunt diversae, quot diversas formas
ab initio creavit infinitum ens</i>&rdquo;&mdash;(There are just so many
distinct species as there were distinct types created in
the beginning by the Infinite). This theosophic dogma
cut short all attempt at a natural explanation of
the origin of species. Linné was acquainted only with
the plant and animal worlds that exist to-day; he had
no suspicion of the much more numerous extinct species
which had peopled the earth with their varying
forms in the earlier period of its development.</p>

<p>It was not until the beginning of the nineteenth cen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>tury
that we were introduced to these fossil animals by
Cuvier. In his famous work on the fossil bones of the
four-footed vertebrates he gave (1812) the first correct
description and true interpretation of many of these fossil
remains. He showed, too, that a series of very different
animal populations have succeeded each other
in the various stages of the earth&rsquo;s history. Since Cuvier
held firmly to Linné&rsquo;s idea of the absolute permanency
of species, he thought their origin could only be
explained by the supposition that a series of great cataclysms
and new creations had marked the history of
the globe; he imagined that all living creatures were
destroyed at the commencement of each of these terrestrial
revolutions, and an entirely new population was
created at its close. Although this &ldquo;catastrophic theory&rdquo;
of Cuvier&rsquo;s led to the most absurd consequences,
and was nothing more than a bald faith in miracles,
it obtained almost universal recognition, and reigned
triumphant until the coming of Darwin.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand that these prevalent ideas of
the absolute unchangeability and supernatural creation
of organic species could not satisfy the more penetrating
thinkers. We find several eminent minds already,
in the second half of the last century, busy with
the attempt to find a natural explanation of the &ldquo;problem
of creation.&rdquo; Pre-eminent among them was the
great German poet and philosopher, Wolfgang Goethe,
who, by his long and assiduous study of morphology,
obtained, more than a hundred years ago, a clear insight
into the intimate connection of all organic forms,
and a firm conviction of a common natural origin.
In his famed <i>Metamorphosis of Plants</i> (1790) he derived
all the different species of plants from one primitive
type, and all their different organs from one primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
organ&mdash;the leaf. In his vertebral theory of the skull
he endeavored to prove that the skulls of the vertebrates&mdash;including
man&mdash;were all alike made up of certain
groups of bones, arranged in a definite structure, and
that these bones are nothing else than transformed vertebræ.
It was his penetrating study of comparative
osteology that led Goethe to a firm conviction of the
unity of the animal organization; he had recognized
that the human skeleton is framed on the same fundamental
type as that of all other vertebrates&mdash;&ldquo;built
on a primitive plan that only deviates more or less to
one side or other in its very constant features, and still
develops and refashions itself daily.&rdquo; This remodelling,
or transformation, is brought about, according to
Goethe, by the constant interaction of two powerful
constructive forces&mdash;a centripetal force within the organism,
the &ldquo;tendency to specification,&rdquo; and a centrifugal
force without, the tendency to variation, or the
&ldquo;idea of metamorphosis&rdquo;; the former corresponds to
what we now call heredity, the latter to the modern idea
of adaptation. How deeply Goethe had penetrated into
their character by these philosophic studies of the &ldquo;construction
and reconstruction of organic natures,&rdquo; and
how far, therefore, he must be considered the most important
precursor of Darwin and Lamarck,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> may be
gathered from the interesting passages from his works
which I have collected in the fourth chapter of my
<i>Natural History of Creation</i>. These evolutionary ideas
of Goethe, however, like analogous ideas of Kant,
Owen, Treviranus, and other philosophers of the commencement
of the century (which we have quoted in
the above work), did not amount to more than certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
general conclusions. They had not that great lever
which the &ldquo;natural history of creation&rdquo; needed for
its firm foundation on a criticism of the dogma of fixed
species; this lever was first supplied by Lamarck.</p>

<p>The first thorough attempt at a scientific establishment
of transformism was made at the beginning of
the nineteenth century by the great French scientist
Jean Lamarck, the chief opponent of his colleague,
Cuvier, at Paris. He had already, in 1802, in his <i>Observations
on Living Organisms</i>, expressed the new
ideas as to the mutability and formation of species,
which he thoroughly established in 1809 in the two volumes
of his profound work, <i>Philosophie Zoologique</i>. In
this work he first gave expression to the correct idea,
in opposition to the prevalent dogma of fixed species,
that the organic &ldquo;species&rdquo; is an <i>artificial abstraction</i>,
a concept of only relative value, like the wider-ranging
concepts of genus, family, order, and class. He went
on to affirm that all species are changeable, and have
arisen from older species in the course of very long
periods of time. The common parent forms from which
they have descended were originally very simple and
lowly organisms. The first and oldest of them arose
by abiogenesis. While the type is preserved by <i>heredity</i>
in the succession of generations, <i>adaptation</i>, on the
other hand, effects a constant modification of the species
by change of habits and the exercise of the various organs.
Even our human organism has arisen in the
same natural manner, by gradual transformation, from
a group of pithecoid mammals. For all these phenomena&mdash;indeed,
for all phenomena both in nature and in
the mind&mdash;Lamarck takes exclusively mechanical,
physical, and chemical activities to be the true efficient
causes. His magnificent <i>Philosophie Zoologique</i> con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>tains
all the elements of a purely monistic system of
nature on the basis of evolution. I have fully treated
these achievements of Lamarck in the fourth chapter
of my <i>Anthropogeny</i>, and in the fourth chapter of the
<i>Natural History of Creation</i>.</p>

<p>Science had now to wait until this great effort to give
a scientific foundation to the theory of evolution should
shatter the dominant myth of a &ldquo;specific creation, and
open out the path of natural&rdquo; development. In this
respect Lamarck was not more successful in resisting
the conservative authority of his great opponent, Cuvier,
than was his colleague and sympathizer, Geoffrey St.
Hilaire, twenty years later. The famous controversies
which he had with Cuvier in the Parisian Academy in
1830 ended with the complete triumph of the latter.
I have elsewhere fully described these conflicts, in
which Goethe took so lively an interest. The great expansion
which the study of biology experienced at that
time, the abundance of interesting discoveries in comparative
anatomy and physiology, the establishment
of the cellular theory, and the progress of ontogeny,
gave zoologists and botanists so overwhelming a flood
of welcome material to deal with that the difficult and
obscure question of the origin of species was easily forgotten
for a time. People rested content with the old
dogma of creation. Even when Charles Lyell refuted
Cuvier&rsquo;s extraordinary &ldquo;catastrophic theory&rdquo; in his
<i>Principles of Geology</i>, in 1830, and vindicated a natural,
continuous evolution for the inorganic structure
of our planet, his simple principle of continuity found
no one to apply it to the inorganic world. The rudiments
of a natural phylogeny which were buried in
Lamarck&rsquo;s works were as completely forgotten as the
germ of a natural ontogeny which Caspar Friedrich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Wolff had given fifty years earlier in his <i>Theory of
Generation</i>. In both cases a full half-century elapsed
before the great idea of a natural development won
a fitting recognition. Only when Darwin (in 1859)
approached the solution of the problem from a different
side altogether, and made a happy use of the
rich treasures of empirical knowledge which had
accumulated in the mean time, did men begin to
think once more of Lamarck as his great precursor.</p>

<p>The unparalleled success of Charles Darwin is well
known. It shows him to-day, at the close of the century,
to have been, if not the greatest, at least the most
effective of its distinguished scientists. No other of
the many great thinkers of our time has achieved so
magnificent, so thorough, and so far-reaching a success
with a single classical work as Darwin did in 1859
with his famous <i>Origin of Species</i>. It is true that the
reform of comparative anatomy and physiology by
Johannes Müller had inaugurated a new and fertile
epoch for the whole of biology, that the establishment
of the cellular theory by Schleiden and Schwann, the
reform of ontogeny by Baer, and the formulation of
the law of substance by Robert Mayer and Helmholtz
were scientific facts of the first importance; but no
one of them has had so profound an influence on the
whole structure of human knowledge as Darwin&rsquo;s
theory of the natural origin of species. For it at once
gave us the solution of the mystic &ldquo;problem of creation,&rdquo;
the great &ldquo;question of all questions&rdquo;&mdash;the problem
of the true character and origin of man himself.</p>

<p>If we compare the two great founders of transformism,
we find in Lamarck a preponderant inclination to
<i>deduction</i>, and to forming a completely monistic scheme
of nature; in Darwin we have a predominant applica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>tion
of <i>induction</i>, and a prudent concern to establish
the different parts of the theory of selection as firmly
as possible on a basis of observation and experiment.
While the French scientist far outran the then limits
of empirical knowledge, and rather sketched the programme
of future investigation, the English empiricist
was mainly preoccupied about securing a unifying
principle of interpretation for a mass of empirical
knowledge which had hitherto accumulated without
being understood. We can thus understand how it
was that the success of Darwin was just as overwhelming
as that of Lamarck was evanescent. Darwin,
however, had not only the signal merit of bringing
all the results of the various biological sciences to a
common focus in the principle of descent, and thus
giving them a harmonious interpretation, but he also
discovered, in the principle of selection, that direct
cause of transformation which Lamarck had missed.
In applying, as a practical breeder, the experience of
artificial selection to organisms in a state of nature,
and in recognizing in the &ldquo;struggle for life&rdquo; the selective
principle of natural selection, Darwin created
his momentous &ldquo;theory of selection,&rdquo; which is what
we properly call Darwinism.</p>

<p>One of the most pressing of the many important
tasks which Darwin proposed to modern biology was
the reform of the zoological and botanical system.
Since the innumerable species of animals and plants
were not created by a supernatural miracle, but evolved
by natural processes, their ancestral tree is their &ldquo;natural
system.&rdquo; The first attempt to frame a system in
this sense was made by myself in 1866, in my <i>General
Morphology of Organisms</i>. The first volume of this
work (&ldquo;General Anatomy&rdquo;) dealt with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>&ldquo;mechanical
science of the developed forms&rdquo;; the second volume
(&ldquo;General Evolution&rdquo;) was occupied with the science
of the &ldquo;developing forms.&rdquo; The systematic introduction
to the latter formed a &ldquo;genealogical survey of the
natural system of organisms.&rdquo; Until that time the
term &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; had been taken to mean exclusively,
both in zoology and botany, the development of individual
organisms&mdash;embryology, or metamorphic science.
I established the opposite view, that this history
of the embryo (ontogeny) must be completed by a
second, equally valuable, and closely connected branch
of thought&mdash;the history of the race (phylogeny). Both
these branches of evolutionary science are, in my opinion,
in the closest causal connection; this arises from
the reciprocal action of the laws of heredity and adaptation;
it has a precise and comprehensive expression
in my &ldquo;fundamental law of biogeny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the new views I had put forward in my <i>General
Morphology</i> met with very little notice, and still less
acceptance, from my scientific colleagues, in spite of
their severely scientific setting, I thought I would
make the most important of them accessible to a wider
circle of informed readers by a smaller work, written
in a more popular style. This was done in 1868, in
<i>The Natural History of Creation</i> (a series of popular
scientific lectures on evolution in general, and the systems
of Darwin, Goethe, and Lamarck in particular).
If the success of my <i>General Morphology</i> was far below
my reasonable anticipation, that of <i>The Natural History
of Creation</i> went far beyond it. In a period of
thirty years nine editions and twelve different translations
of it have appeared. In spite of its great defects,
the book has contributed much to the popularization
of the main ideas of modern evolution. Still, I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
only give the barest outlines in it of my chief object,
the phylogenetic construction of a natural system. I
have, therefore, given the complete proof, which is
wanting in the earlier work, of the phylogenetic system
in a subsequent larger work, my <i>Systematic Phylogeny</i>
(outlines of a natural system of organisms on the
basis of their specific development). The first volume
of it deals with the protists and plants (1894), the second
with the invertebrate animals (1896), the third with the
vertebrates (1895). The ancestral tree of both the
smaller and the larger groups is carried on in this
work as far as my knowledge of the three great
&ldquo;ancestral documents&rdquo;&mdash;palæontology, ontogeny, and
morphology&mdash;qualified me to extend it.</p>

<p>I had already, in my <i>General Morphology</i> (at the
end of the fifth book), described the close causative
connection which exists, in my opinion, between the
two branches of organic evolution as one of the most
important ideas of transformism, and I had framed a
precise formula for it in a number of &ldquo;theses on the
causal nexus of biontic and phyletic development&rdquo;:
&ldquo;<i>Ontogenesis is a brief and rapid recapitulation of phylogenesis</i>,
determined by the physiological functions of
heredity (generation) and adaptation (maintenance).&rdquo;
Darwin himself had emphasized the great significance
of his theory for the elucidation of embryology in 1859,
and Fritz Müller had endeavored to prove it as regards
the Crustacea in the able little work, <i>Facts and Arguments
for Darwin</i> (1864). My own task has been to
prove the universal application and the fundamental
importance of the biogenetic law in a series of works,
especially in the <i>Biology of the Calcispongiae</i> (1872), and
in <i>Studies on the Gastraea Theory</i> (1873-1884). The
theory of the homology of the germinal layers and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the relations of <i>palingenesis</i> to <i>cenogenesis</i> which I have
exposed in them has been confirmed subsequently by
a number of works of other zoologists. That theory
makes it possible to follow nature&rsquo;s law of unity in the
innumerable variations of animal embryology; it gives
us for their ancestral history a common derivation from
a simple primitive stem form.</p>

<p>The far-seeing founder of the theory of descent,
Lamarck, clearly recognized in 1809 that it was of universal
application; that even man himself, the most
highly developed of the mammals, is derived from the
same stem as all the other mammals; and that this in
its turn belongs to the same older branch of the ancestral
tree as the rest of the vertebrates. He had even
indicated the agencies by which it might be possible to
explain man&rsquo;s descent from the apes as the nearest related
mammals. Darwin, who was, naturally, of the
same conviction, purposely avoided this least acceptable
consequence of his theory in his chief work in 1859,
and put it forward for the first time in his <i>Descent of
Man</i> in 1871. In the mean time (1863) Huxley had
very ably discussed this most important consequence
of evolution in his famous <i>Place of Man in Nature</i>.
With the aid of comparative anatomy and ontogeny,
and the support of the facts of palæontology, Huxley
proved that the &ldquo;descent of man from the ape&rdquo; is a
necessary consequence of Darwinism, and that no other
scientific explanation of the origin of the human race
is possible. Of the same opinion was Karl Gegenbaur,
the most distinguished representative of comparative
anatomy, who lifted his science to a higher level by
a consistent and ingenious application of the theory of
descent.</p>

<p>As a further consequence of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>&ldquo;pithecoid theory&rdquo;
(the theory of the descent of man from the ape) there
now arose the difficult task of investigating, not only
the nearest related mammal ancestors of man in the
Tertiary epoch, but also the long series of the older animal
ancestors which had lived in earlier periods of the
earth&rsquo;s history and been developed in the course of
countless millions of years. I had made a start with
the hypothetical solution of this great historic problem
in my <i>General Morphology</i>; a further development of
it appeared in 1874 in my <i>Anthropogeny</i> (first section,
Origin of the Individual; second section, Origin of the
Race). The fourth, enlarged, edition of this work
(1891) contains that theory of the development of man
which approaches nearest, in my own opinion, to the
still remote truth, in the light of our present knowledge
of the documentary evidence. I was especially preoccupied
in its composition to use the three empirical
&ldquo;documents&rdquo;&mdash;palæontology, ontogeny, and morphology
(or comparative anatomy)&mdash;as evenly and harmoniously
as possible. It is true that my hypotheses
were in many cases supplemented and corrected in detail
by later phylogenetic research; yet I am convinced
that the ancestral tree of human origin which I have
sketched therein is substantially correct. For the historical
succession of vertebrate fossils corresponds completely
with the morphological evolutionary scale which
is revealed to us by comparative anatomy and ontogeny.
After the Silurian fishes come the <i>dipnoi</i> of the Devonian
period&mdash;the Carboniferous amphibia, the Permian
reptilia, and the Mesozoic mammals. Of these, again,
the lowest forms, the monotremes, appear first in the
Triassic period, the marsupials in the Jurassic, and
then the oldest placentals in the Cretaceous. Of the
placentals, in turn, the first to appear in the oldest Ter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>tiary
period (the Eocene) are the lowest primates, the
prosimiæ, which are followed by the simiæ in the Miocene.
Of the catarrhinæ, the cynopitheci precede the
anthropomorpha; from one branch of the latter, during
the Pliocene period, arises the ape-man without
speech (the <i>pithecanthropus alalus</i>); and from him descends,
finally, speaking man.</p>

<p>The chain of our earlier invertebrate ancestors is
much more difficult to investigate and much less safe
than this tree of our vertebrate predecessors; we have
no fossilized relics of their soft, boneless structures, so
palæontology can give us no assistance in this case.
The evidence of comparative anatomy and ontogeny,
therefore, becomes all the more important. Since the
human embryo passes through the same <i>chordula</i>-stage
as the germs of all other vertebrates, since it evolves,
similarly, out of two germinal layers of a <i>gastrula</i>, we
infer, in virtue of the biogenetic law, the early existence
of corresponding ancestral forms&mdash;vermalia, gastræada,
etc. Most important of all is the fact that the
human embryo, like that of all other animals, arises
originally from a single cell; for this &ldquo;stem-cell&rdquo;
(<i>cytula</i>)&mdash;the impregnated egg cell&mdash;points indubitably
to a corresponding unicellular ancestor, a primitive,
Laurentian protozoon.</p>

<p>For the purpose of our monistic philosophy, however,
it is a matter of comparative indifference how the succession
of our animal predecessors may be confirmed
in detail. Sufficient for us, as an incontestable historical
fact, is the important thesis that man descends
immediately from the ape, and secondarily from a long
series of lower vertebrates. I have laid stress on the
logical proof of this &ldquo;pithecometra-thesis&rdquo; in the seventh
book of the <i>General Morphology</i>: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>&ldquo;The thesis
that man has been evolved from lower vertebrates, and
immediately from the <i>simiae</i>, is a special inference
which results with absolute necessity from the general
inductive law of the theory of descent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the definitive proof and establishment of this
fundamental pithecometra-thesis the palæontological
discoveries of the last thirty years are of the greatest
importance; in particular, the astonishing discoveries
of a number of extinct mammals of the Tertiary period
have enabled us to draw up clearly in its main outlines
the evolutionary history of this most important class
of animals, from the lowest oviparous monotremes up
to man. The four chief groups of the placentals, the
heterogeneous legions of the carnassia, the rodentia,
the ungulata, and the primates, seem to be separated
by profound gulfs, when we confine our attention to
their representatives of to-day. But these gulfs are
completely bridged, and the sharp distinctions of the
four legions are entirely lost, when we compare their
extinct predecessors of the Tertiary period, and when
we go back into the Eocene twilight of history, in
the oldest part of the Tertiary period&mdash;at least three
million years ago. There we find the great sub-class
of the placentals, which to-day comprises more
than two thousand five hundred species, represented
by only a small number of little, insignificant &ldquo;proplacentals&rdquo;;
and in these <i>prochoriata</i> the characters
of the four divergent legions are so intermingled and
toned down that we cannot in reason do other than
consider them as the precursors of those features. The
oldest carnassia (the <i>ictopsales</i>), the oldest rodentia (the
<i>esthonychales</i>), the oldest ungulata (the <i>condylarthrales</i>)
and the oldest primates (the <i>lemuravales</i>), all have the
same fundamental skeletal structure, and the same typ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>ical
dentition of the primitive placentals, consisting of
forty-four teeth (three incisors, one canine, four premolars,
and three molars in each half of the jaw); all
are characterized by the small size and the imperfect
structure of the brain (especially of its chief part, the
cortex, which does not become a true &ldquo;organ of thought&rdquo;
until later on in the Miocene and Pliocene representatives);
they have all short legs and five-toed, flat-soled
feet (<i>plantigrada</i>). In many cases among these oldest
placentals of the Eocene period it was very difficult to
say at first whether they should be classed with the
carnassia, rodentia, ungulata, or primates; so very
closely, even to confusion, do these four groups of the
placentals, which diverge so widely afterwards, approach
each other at that time. Their common origin
from a single ancestral group follows incontestably.
These <i>prochoriata</i> lived in the preceding Cretaceous
period (more than three million years ago), and were
probably developed in the Jurassic period from a group
of insectivorous marsupials (<i>amphitheria</i>) by the formation
of a primitive <i>placenta diffusa</i>, a placenta of
the simplest type.</p>

<p>But the most important of all the recent palaeontological
discoveries which have served to elucidate the
origin of the placentals relate to our own stem, the legion
of primates. Formerly fossil remains of the primates
were very scarce. Even Cuvier, the great founder of
palaeontology, maintained until his last day (1832) that
there were no fossilized primates; he had himself, it is
true, described the skull of an Eocene prosimiæ (<i>adapis</i>),
but he had wrongly classed it with the ungulata. However,
during the last twenty years a fair number of well-preserved
fossilized skeletons of prosimiæ and simiæ
have been discovered; in them we find all the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
intermediate members which complete the connecting
chain of ancestors from the oldest prosimiæ to
man.</p>

<p>The most famous and most interesting of these discoveries
is the fossil ape-man of Java, the much-talked-of
<i>pithecanthropus erectus</i>, found by a Dutch military
doctor, Eugen Dubois, in 1894. It is in truth the much-sought
&ldquo;missing link,&rdquo; supposed to be wanting in the
chain of primates, which stretches unbroken from the
lowest catarrhinæ to the highest-developed man. I
have dealt exhaustively with the significance of this discovery
in the paper which I read on August 26, 1898,
at the Fourth International Zoological Congress at
Cambridge.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The palæontologist, who knows the conditions
of the formation and preservation of fossils, will
think the discovery of the pithecanthropus an unusually
lucky accident. The apes, being arboreal, seldom
came into the circumstances (unless they happened to
fall into the water) which would secure the preservation
and petrifaction of their skeleton. Thus, by the
discovery of this fossil man-monkey of Java the descent
of man from the ape has become just as clear and certain
from the palæontological side as it was previously from
the evidence of comparative anatomy and ontogeny.
We now have all the principal documents which tell
the history of our race.</p>

<p>The phenomena which are comprised under the title
of the &ldquo;life of the soul,&rdquo; or the psychic activity,
are, on the one hand, the most important and interesting,
on the other the most intricate and problematical,
of all the phenomena we are acquainted with. As
the knowledge of nature, the object of the present
philosophic study, is itself a part of the life of the soul,
and as anthropology, and even cosmology, presuppose
a correct knowledge of the &ldquo;psyche,&rdquo; we may regard
psychology, the scientific study of the soul, both as
the foundation and the postulate of all other sciences.
From another point of view it is itself a part of philosophy,
or physiology, or anthropology.</p>

<p>The great difficulty of establishing it on a naturalistic
basis arises from the fact that psychology, in turn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
presupposes a correct acquaintance with the human
organism, especially the brain, the chief organ of
psychic activity. The great majority of &ldquo;psychologists&rdquo;
have little or no acquaintance with these anatomical
foundations of the soul, and thus it happens
that in no other science do we find such contradictions
and untenable notions as to its proper meaning and its
essential object as are current in psychology. This
confusion has become more and more palpable during
the last thirty years, in proportion as the immense
progress of anatomy and physiology has increased our
knowledge of the structure and the functions of the
chief psychic organ.</p>

<p>What we call the soul is, in my opinion, a natural
phenomenon; I therefore consider psychology to be a
branch of natural science&mdash;a section of physiology.
Consequently, I must emphatically assert from the
commencement that we have no different methods of
research for that science than for any of the others;
we have in the first place observation and experiment,
in the second place the theory of evolution, and in the
third place metaphysical speculation, which seek to
penetrate as far as possible into the cryptic nature of
the phenomena by inductive and deductive reasoning.
However, with a view to a thorough appreciation of
the question, we must first of all put clearly before the
reader the antithesis of the dualistic and the monistic
theories.</p>

<p>The prevailing conception of the psychic activity,
which we contest, considers soul and body to be two
distinct entities. These two entities can exist independently
of each other; there is no intrinsic necessity
for their union. The organized body is a mortal,
material nature, chemically composed of living proto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>plasm
and its compounds (plasma-products). The soul,
on the other hand, is an immortal, immaterial being,
a spiritual agent, whose mysterious activity is entirely
incomprehensible to us. This trivial conception is,
as such, spiritualistic, and its contradictory is, in a
certain sense, materialistic. It is, at the same time,
supernatural and transcendental, since it affirms the
existence of forces which can exist and operate without
a material basis; it rests on the assumption that outside
of and beyond nature there is a &ldquo;spiritual,&rdquo; immaterial
world, of which we have no experience, and
of which we can learn nothing by natural means.</p>

<p>This hypothetical &ldquo;spirit world,&rdquo; which is supposed
to be entirely independent of the material universe,
and on the assumption of which the whole artificial
structure of the dualistic system is based, is purely a
product of poetic imagination; the same must be said
of the parallel belief in the &ldquo;immortality of the soul,&rdquo;
the scientific impossibility of which we must prove
more fully later on (<a href="#CHAPTER_XI">chap. xi</a>.). If the beliefs which
prevail in these credulous circles had a sound foundation,
the phenomena they relate to could not be subject
to the &ldquo;law of substance&rdquo;; moreover, this single exception
to the highest law of the cosmos must have appeared
very late in the history of the organic world,
since it only concerns the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; of man and of the
higher animals. The dogma of &ldquo;free will,&rdquo; another
essential element of the dualistic psychology, is similarly
irreconcilable with the universal law of substance.</p>

<p>Our own naturalistic conception of the psychic activity
sees in it a group of vital phenomena, which are dependent
on a definite material substratum, like all other
phenomena. We shall give to this material basis of
all psychic activity, without which it is inconceivable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the provisional name of &ldquo;psychoplasm&rdquo;; and for this
good reason&mdash;that chemical analysis proves it to be a
body of the group we call protoplasmic bodies the albuminoid
carbon-combinations which are at the root
of all vital processes. In the higher animals, which
have a nervous system and sense-organs, &ldquo;neuroplasm,&rdquo;
the nerve-material, has been differentiated out
of psychoplasm. Our conception is, in this sense, materialistic.
It is at the same time empirical and naturalistic,
for our scientific experience has never yet
taught us the existence of forces that can dispense
with a material substratum, or of a spiritual world
over and above the realm of nature.</p>

<p>Like all other natural phenomena, the psychic processes
are subject to the supreme, all-ruling law of substance;
not even in this province is there a single exception
to this highest cosmological law (compare <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">chap.
xii</a>.). The phenomena of the lowly psychic life of the
unicellular protist and the plant, and of the lowest animal
forms&mdash;their irritability, their reflex movements,
their sensitiveness and instinct of self-preservation&mdash;are
directly determined by physiological action in the
protoplasm of their cells&mdash;that is, by physical and
chemical changes which are partly due to heredity and
partly to adaptation. And we must say just the same
of the higher psychic activity of the higher animals and
man, of the formation of ideas and concepts, of the marvellous
phenomena of reason and consciousness; for
the latter have been phylogenetically evolved from the
former, and it is merely a higher degree of integration
or centralization, of association or combination of functions
which were formerly isolated, that has elevated
them in this manner.</p>

<p>The first task of every science is the clear definition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of the object it has to investigate. In no science, however,
is this preliminary task so difficult as in psychology;
and this circumstance is the more remarkable
since logic, the science of defining, is itself a part of
psychology. When we compare all that has been said
by the most distinguished philosophers and scientists
of all ages on the fundamental idea of psychology, we
find ourselves in a perfect chaos of contradictory notions.
What, really, is the &ldquo;soul&rdquo;? What is its relation
to the &ldquo;mind&rdquo;? What is the inner meaning of
&ldquo;consciousness&rdquo;? What is the difference between
&ldquo;sensation&rdquo; and &ldquo;sentiment&rdquo;? What is &ldquo;instinct&rdquo;?
What is the meaning of &ldquo;free will&rdquo;? What is &ldquo;presentation&rdquo;?
What is the difference between &ldquo;intellect&rdquo;
and &ldquo;reason&rdquo;? What is the true nature of &ldquo;emotion&rdquo;?
What is the relation between all these &ldquo;psychic
phenomena&rdquo; and the &ldquo;body&rdquo;? The answers to these
and many other cognate questions are infinitely varied;
not only are the views of the most eminent thinkers
on these questions widely divergent, but even the same
scientific authority has often completely changed his
views in the course of his psychological development.
Indeed, this &ldquo;psychological metamorphosis&rdquo; of so
many thinkers has contributed not a little to the <i>colossal
confusion of ideas</i> which prevails in psychology
more than in any other branch of knowledge.</p>

<p>The most interesting example of such an entire
change of objective and subjective psychological opinions
is found in the case of the most influential leader
of German philosophy, Immanuel Kant. The young,
severely <i>critical</i> Kant came to the conclusion that the
three great buttresses of mysticism&mdash;&ldquo;God, freedom,
and immortality&rdquo;&mdash;were untenable in the light of &ldquo;pure
reason&rdquo;; the older, <i>dogmatic</i> Kant found that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
three great hallucinations were postulates of &ldquo;practical
reason,&rdquo; and were, as such, indispensable. The
more the distinguished modern school of &ldquo;Neokantians&rdquo;
urges a &ldquo;return to Kant&rdquo; as the only possible
salvation from the frightful jumble of modern metaphysics,
the more clearly do we perceive the undeniable
and fatal contradiction between the fundamental opinions
of the young and the older Kant. We shall return
to this point later on.</p>

<p>Other interesting examples of this change of views
are found in two of the most famous living scientists,
R. Virchow and E. du Bois-Reymond; the metamorphoses
of their fundamental views on psychology cannot
be overlooked, as both these Berlin biologists have
played a most important part at Germany&rsquo;s greatest
university for more than forty years, and have, therefore,
directly and indirectly, had a most profound influence
on the modern mind. Rudolph Virchow, the
eminent founder of cellular pathology, was a <i>pure monist</i>
in the best days of his scientific activity, about the
middle of the century; he passed at that time as one
of the most distinguished representatives of the newly
awakened <i>materialism</i>, which appeared in 1855, especially
through two famous works, almost contemporaneous
in appearance&mdash;Ludwig Büchner&rsquo;s <i>Matter and
Force</i> and Carl Vogt&rsquo;s <i>Superstition and Science</i>. Virchow
published his general biological views on the vital
processes in man&mdash;which he takes to be purely mechanical
natural phenomena&mdash;in a series of distinguished
papers in the first volumes of the <i>Archiv für
pathologische Anatomie</i>, which he founded. The most
important of these articles, and the one in which he
most clearly expresses his monistic views of that
period, is that on <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>&ldquo;The Tendencies Towards Unity
in Scientific Medicine&rdquo; (1849). It was certainly not
without careful thought, and a conviction of its philosophic
value, that Virchow put this &ldquo;medical confession
of faith&rdquo; at the head of his <i>Collected Essays on
Scientific Medicine</i> in 1856. He defended in it, clearly
and definitely, the fundamental principles of monism,
which I am presenting here with a view to the solution
of the world-problem; he vindicated the exclusive
title of empirical science, of which the only reliable
sources are sense and brain activity; he vigorously
attacked anthropological dualism, the alleged &ldquo;revelation,&rdquo;
and the transcendental philosophy, with their
two methods&mdash;&ldquo;faith and anthropomorphism.&rdquo; Above
all, he emphasized the monistic character of anthropology,
the inseparable connection of spirit and body,
of force and matter. &ldquo;I am convinced,&rdquo; he exclaims,
at the end of his preface, &ldquo;that I shall never find
myself compelled to deny the thesis of <i>the unity</i> of
human nature.&rdquo; Unhappily, this &ldquo;conviction&rdquo; proved
to be a grave error. Twenty-eight years afterwards
Virchow represented the diametrically opposite view;
it is to be found in the famous speech on &ldquo;The Liberty
of Science in Modern States,&rdquo; which he delivered at the
Scientific Congress at Munich in 1877, and which contains
attacks that I have repelled in my <i>Free Science
and Free Teaching</i> (1878).</p>

<p>In Emil du Bois-Reymond we find similar contradictions
with regard to the most important and fundamental
theses of philosophy. The more completely
the distinguished orator of the Berlin Academy had
defended the main principles of the monistic philosophy,
the more he had contributed to the refutation of
vitalism and the transcendental view of life, so much
the louder was the triumphant cry of our opponents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
when in 1872, in his famous <i>Ignorabimus-Speech</i>, he
spoke of consciousness as an insoluble problem, and
opposed it to the other functions of the brain as a supernatural
phenomenon. I return to the point in the
<a href="#CHAPTER_X">tenth chapter</a>.</p>

<p>The peculiar character of many of the psychic phenomena,
especially of consciousness, necessitates certain
modifications of our ordinary scientific methods.
We have, for instance, to associate with the customary
<i>objective</i>, external observation, the <i>introspective</i> method,
the <i>subjective</i>, internal observation which scrutinizes
our own personality in the mirror of consciousness.
The majority of psychologists have started from this
&ldquo;certainty of the ego&rdquo;: &ldquo;<i>Cogito ergo sum</i>,&rdquo; as Descartes
said&mdash;I think, therefore I am. Let us first cast
a glance at this way of inquiry, and then deal with the
second, complementary, method.</p>

<p>By far the greater part of the theories of the soul which
have been put forward during the last two thousand
years or more are based on introspective inquiry&mdash;that
is, on &ldquo;self-observation,&rdquo; and on the conclusions which
we draw from the association and criticism of these
subjective experiences. Introspection is the only possible
method of inquiry for an important section of
psychology, especially for the study of consciousness.
Hence this cerebral function occupies a special position,
and has been a more prolific source of philosophic
error than any of the others (cf. <a href="#CHAPTER_X">chap. x</a>.). It is, however,
most unsatisfactory, and it leads to entirely false
or incomplete notions, to take this self-observation of
the mind to be the chief, or, especially, to be the only
source of mental science, as has happened in the case
of many and distinguished philosophers. A great
number of the principal psychic phenomena, particu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>larly
the activity of the senses and speech, can only be
studied in the same way as every other vital function
of the organism&mdash;that is, firstly, by a thorough anatomical
study of their organs, and, secondly, by an exact
physiological analysis of the functions which depend
on them. In order, however, to complete this external
study of the mental life, and to supplement the results
of <i>internal</i> observation, one needs a thorough knowledge
of human anatomy, histology, ontogeny, and
physiology. Most of our so-called &ldquo;psychologists&rdquo;
have little or no knowledge of these indispensable foundations
of anthropology; they are, therefore, incompetent
to pronounce on the character even of their own
&ldquo;soul.&rdquo; It must be remembered, too, that the distinguished
personality of one of these psychologists usually
offers a specimen of an educated mind of the highest
civilized races; it is the last link of a long ancestral
chain, and the innumerable older and inferior links are
indispensable for its proper understanding. Hence it
is that most of the psychological literature of the day is
so much waste paper. The introspective method is certainly
extremely valuable and indispensable; still it
needs the constant co-operation and assistance of the
other methods.</p>

<p>In proportion as the various branches of the human
tree of knowledge have developed during the century,
and the methods of the different sciences have been
perfected, the desire has grown to make them <i>exact</i>;
that is, to make the study of phenomena as purely empirical
as possible, and to formulate the laws that result
as clearly as the circumstances permit&mdash;if possible,
<i>mathematically</i>. The latter is, however, only feasible
in a small province of human knowledge, especially in
those sciences in which there is question of measurable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
quantities; in mathematics, in the first place, and to a
greater or less extent in astronomy, mechanics, and a
great part of physics and chemistry. Hence these
studies are called &ldquo;exact sciences&rdquo; in the narrower
sense. It is, however, productive only of error to call
all the physical sciences <i>exact</i>, and oppose them to the
historical, mental, and moral sciences. The greater
part of physical science can no more be treated as an
<i>exact</i> science than history can; this is especially true
of biology and of its subsidiary branch, psychology.
As psychology is a part of physiology, it must, as a
general rule, follow the chief methods of that science.
It must establish the facts of psychic activity by empirical
methods as much as possible, by observation
and experiment, and it must then gather the laws of
the mind by inductive and deductive inferences from
its observations, and formulate them with the utmost
distinctness. But, for obvious reasons, it is rarely possible
to formulate them mathematically. Such a procedure
is only profitable in one section of the physiology
of the senses; it is not practicable in the greater part
of cerebral physiology.</p>

<p>One small section of physiology, which seems amenable
to the &ldquo;exact&rdquo; method of investigation, has been
carefully studied for the last twenty years and raised
to the position of a separate science under the title of
<i>psycho-physics</i>. Its founders, the physiologists Theodor
Fechner and Ernst Heinrich Weber, first of all closely
investigated the dependence of sensations on the external
stimuli that act on the organs of sense, and particularly
the quantitative relation between the strength
of the stimulus and the intensity of the sensation. They
found that a certain minimum strength of stimulus is
requisite for the excitement of a sensation, and that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
given stimulus must be varied to a definite amount
before there is any perceptible change in the sensation.
For the highest sensations (of sight, hearing, and pressure)
the law holds good that their variations are proportionate
to the changes in the strength of the stimulus.
From this empirical &ldquo;law of Weber&rdquo; Fechner inferred,
by mathematical operations, his &ldquo;fundamental law of
psycho-physics,&rdquo; according to which the intensity of
a sensation increases in arithmetical progression, the
strength of the stimulus in geometrical progression.
However, Fechner&rsquo;s law and other psycho-physical laws
are frequently contested, and their &ldquo;exactness&rdquo; is
called into question. In any case modern psycho-physics
has fallen far short of the great hopes with
which it was greeted twenty years ago; the field of its
applicability is extremely limited. One important result
of its work is that it has proved the application of
physical laws in one, if only a small, branch of the life
of the &ldquo;soul&rdquo;&mdash;an application which was long ago postulated
on principle by the materialist psychology for
the whole province of mental life. In this, as in many
other branches of physiology, the &ldquo;exact&rdquo; method has
proved inadequate and of little service. It is the ideal
to aim at everywhere, but it is unattainable in most
cases. Much more profitable are the comparative and
genetic methods.</p>

<p>The striking resemblance of man&rsquo;s psychic activity
to that of the higher animals&mdash;especially our nearest
relatives among the mammals&mdash;is a familiar fact.
Most uncivilized races still make no material distinction
between the two sets of mental processes, as the
well-known animal fables, the old legends, and the
idea of the transmigration of souls prove. Even most
of the philosophers of classical antiquity shared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
same conviction, and discovered no essential qualitative
difference, but merely a quantitative one, between
the soul of man and that of the brute. Plato himself,
who was the first to draw a fundamental distinction
between soul and body, made one and the same
soul (or &ldquo;idea&rdquo;) pass through a number of animal and
human bodies in his theory of metempsychosis. It was
Christianity, intimately connecting faith in immortality
with faith in God, that emphasized the essential
difference of the immortal soul of man from the mortal
soul of the brute. In the dualistic philosophy the idea
prevailed principally through the influence of Descartes
(1643); he contended that man alone had a true
&ldquo;soul,&rdquo; and, consequently, sensation and free will, and
that the animals were mere automata, or machines,
without will or sensibility. Ever since the majority of
psychologists&mdash;including even Kant&mdash;have entirely
neglected the mental life of the brute, and restricted
psychological research to man: human psychology,
mainly introspective, dispensed with the fruitful comparative
method, and so remained at that lower point
of view which human morphology took before Cuvier
raised it to the position of a &ldquo;philosophic science&rdquo; by
the foundation of comparative anatomy.</p>

<p>Scientific interest in the psychic activity of the brute
was revived in the second half of the last century, in
connection with the advance of systematic zoology and
physiology. A strong impulse was given to it by the
work of Reimarus: &ldquo;General observations on the instincts
of animals&rdquo; (Hamburg, 1760). At the same
time a deeper scientific investigation had been facilitated
by the thorough reform of physiology by Johannes
Müller. This distinguished biologist, having
a comprehensive knowledge of the whole field of or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>ganic
nature, of morphology, and of physiology, introduced
the &ldquo;exact methods&rdquo; of observation and experiment
into the whole province of physiology, and,
with consummate skill, combined them with the comparative
methods. He applied them, not only to mental
life in the broader sense (to speech, senses, and brain-action),
but to all the other phenomena of life. The
sixth book of his <i>Manual of Human Physiology</i> treats
specially of the life of the soul, and contains eighty
pages of important psychological observations.</p>

<p>During the last forty years a great number of works
on comparative animal psychology have appeared,
principally occasioned by the great impulse which
Darwin gave in 1859 by his work on <i>The Origin of
Species</i>, and by the application of the idea of evolution
to the province of psychology. The more important
of these works we owe to Romanes and Sir J. Lubbock,
in England; to W. Wundt, L. Büchner, G. Schneider,
Fritz Schultze, and Karl Groos, in Germany; to Alfred
Espinas and E. Jourdan, in France; and to Tito Vignoli,
in Italy.</p>

<p>In Germany, Wilhelm Wundt, of Leipzig, is considered
to be the ablest living psychologist; he has the inestimable
advantage over most other philosophers of a
thorough zoological, anatomical, and physiological education.
Formerly assistant and pupil of Helmholtz,
Wundt had early accustomed himself to follow the application
of the laws of physics and chemistry through
the whole field of physiology, and, consequently, in
the sense of Johannes Müller, in <i>psychology</i>, as a subsection
of the latter. Starting from this point of view,
Wundt published his valuable &ldquo;Lectures on human
and animal psychology&rdquo; in 1863. He proved, as he
himself tells us in the preface, that the theatre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
most important psychic processes is in the &ldquo;unconscious
soul,&rdquo; and he affords us &ldquo;a view of the mechanism
which, in the unconscious background of the soul,
manipulates the impressions which arise from the external
stimuli.&rdquo; What seems to me, however, of special
importance and value in Wundt&rsquo;s work is that he
&ldquo;extends the law of the persistence of force for the
first time to the psychic world, and makes use of a
series of facts of electro-physiology by way of demonstration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thirty years afterwards (1892) Wundt published a
second, much abridged and entirely modified, edition
of his work. The important principles of the first edition
are entirely abandoned in the second, and the monistic
is exchanged for a purely dualistic stand-point.
Wundt himself says in the preface to the second edition
that he has emancipated himself from the fundamental
errors of the first, and that he &ldquo;learned many years
ago to consider the work a sin of his youth&rdquo;; it &ldquo;weighed
on him as a kind of crime, from which he longed to free
himself as soon as possible.&rdquo; In fact, the most important
systems of psychology are completely opposed to
each other in the two editions of Wundt&rsquo;s famous <i>Observations</i>.
In the first edition he is purely monistic and
materialistic, in the second edition purely dualistic
and spiritualistic. In the one psychology is treated
as a <i>physical</i> science, on the same laws as the whole of
physiology, of which it is only a part; thirty years afterwards
he finds psychology to be a <i>spiritual</i> science,
with principles and objects entirely different from those
of physical science. This conversion is most clearly
expressed in his principle of psycho-physical parallelism,
according to which &ldquo;every psychic event has a
corresponding physical change&rdquo;; but the two are com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>pletely
independent, and are not in any natural causal
connection. This complete dualism of body and soul,
of nature and mind, naturally gave the liveliest satisfaction
to the prevailing school-philosophy, and was
acclaimed by it as an important advance, especially
seeing that it came from a distinguished scientist who
had previously adhered to the opposite system of monism.
As I myself continue, after more than forty years&rsquo;
study, in this &ldquo;narrow&rdquo; position, and have not been
able to free myself from it in spite of all my efforts, I
must naturally consider the &ldquo;youthful sin&rdquo; of the
young physiologist Wundt to be a correct knowledge
of nature, and energetically defend it against the antagonistic
view of the old philosopher Wundt.</p>

<p>This entire change of philosophical principles, which
we find in Wundt, as we found it in Kant, Virchow,
Du Bois-Reymond, Karl Ernst Baer, and others, is
very interesting. In their youth these able and talented
scientists embrace the whole field of biological
research in a broad survey, and make strenuous efforts
to find a unifying, natural basis for their knowledge;
in their later years they have found that this is not completely
attainable, and so they entirely abandon the
idea. In extenuation of these psychological metamorphoses
they can, naturally, plead that in their youth
they overlooked the difficulties of the great task, and
misconceived the true goal; with the maturer judgment
of age and the accumulation of experience they were
convinced of their errors, and discovered the true path
to the source of truth. On the other hand, it is possible
to think that great scientists approach their task with
less prejudice and more energy in their earlier years&mdash;that
their vision is clearer and their judgment purer;
the experiences of later years sometimes have the effect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
not of enriching, but of disturbing, the mind, and with
old age there comes a gradual decay of the brain, just
as happens in all other organs. In any case, this
change of views is in itself an instructive psychological
fact; because, like many other forms of
change of opinion, it shows that the highest psychic
functions are subject to profound individual changes
in the course of life, like all the other vital processes.</p>

<p>For the profitable construction of comparative psychology
it is extremely important not to confine the critical
comparison to man and the brute in general, but
to put side by side the innumerable gradations of their
mental activity. Only thus can we attain a clear knowledge
of the long scale of psychic development which
runs unbroken from the lowest, unicellular forms of
life up to the mammals, and to man at their head. But
even within the limits of our own race such gradations
are very noticeable, and the ramifications of the &ldquo;psychic
ancestral tree&rdquo; are very numerous. The psychic
difference between the crudest savage of the lowest
grade and the most perfect specimen of the highest civilization
is colossal&mdash;much greater than is commonly
supposed. By the due appreciation of this fact, especially
in the latter half of the century, the &ldquo;Anthropology
of the uncivilized races&rdquo; (Waitz) has received a
strong support, and comparative ethnography has come
to be considered extremely important for psychological
purposes. Unfortunately, the enormous quantity of
raw material of this science has not yet been treated in
a satisfactory critical manner. What confused and
mystic ideas still prevail in this department may be
seen, for instance, in the <i>Völkergedanke</i> of the famous
traveller, Adolf Bastian, who, though a prolific writer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
merely turns out a hopeless mass of uncritical compilation
and confused speculation.</p>

<p>The most neglected of all psychological methods,
even up to the present day, is the evolution of the soul;
yet this little-frequented path is precisely the one that
leads us most quickly and securely through the gloomy
primeval forest of psychological prejudices, dogmas,
and errors, to a clear insight into many of the chief
psychic problems. As I did in the other branch of organic
evolution, I again put before the reader the two
great branches of the science which I differentiated in
1866&mdash;ontogeny and phylogeny. The ontogeny, or
embryonic development, of the soul, individual or biontic
psychogeny, investigates the gradual and hierarchic
development of the soul in the individual, and seeks to
learn the laws by which it is controlled. For a great
part of the life of the mind a good deal has been done
in this direction for centuries; rational pedagogy must
have set itself the task at an early date of the theoretical
study of the gradual development and formative
capacity of the young mind that was committed to it
for education and formation. Most pedagogues, however,
were idealistic or dualistic philosophers, and so
they went to work with all the prejudices of the spiritualistic
psychology. It is only in the last few decades
that this dogmatic tendency has been largely superseded
even in the school by scientific methods; we now
find a greater concern to apply the chief laws of evolution
even in the discussion of the soul of the child. The
raw material of the child&rsquo;s soul is already qualitatively
determined by <i>heredity</i> from parents and ancestors;
education has the noble task of bringing it to a perfect
maturity by intellectual instruction and moral training&mdash;that
is, by <i>adaptation</i>. Wilhelm Preyer was the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
to lay the foundation of our knowledge of the early
psychic development in his interesting work on <i>The
Mind of the Child</i>. Much is still to be done in the
study of the later stages and metamorphoses of the individual
soul, and once more the correct, critical application
of the biogenetic law is proving a guiding star
to the scientific mind.</p>

<p>A new and fertile epoch of higher development
dawned for psychology and all other biological sciences
when Charles Darwin applied the principles of evolution
to them forty years ago. The seventh chapter of
his epoch-making work on <i>The Origin of Species</i> is
devoted to instinct. It contains the valuable proof that
the instincts of animals are subject, like all other vital
processes, to the general laws of historic development.
The special instincts of particular species were formed
by <i>adaptation</i>, and the modifications thus acquired
were handed on to posterity by <i>heredity</i>; in their formation
and preservation natural selection plays the
same part as in the transformation of every other physiological
function. Darwin afterwards developed this
fundamental thought in a number of works, showing
that the same laws of &ldquo;mental evolution&rdquo; hold good
throughout the entire organic world, not less in man
than in the brute, and even in the plant. Hence the
unity of the organic world, which is revealed by the
common origin of its members, applies also to the entire
province of psychic life, from the simplest unicellular
organism up to man.</p>

<p>To George Romanes we owe the further development
of Darwin&rsquo;s psychology and its special application to
the different sections of psychic activity. Unfortunately,
his premature decease prevented the completion of
the great work which was to reconstruct every section<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
of comparative psychology on the lines of monistic evolution.
The two volumes of this work which were completed
are among the most valuable productions of
psychological literature. For, conformably to the principles
of our modern monistic research, his first care
was to collect and arrange all the important facts which
have been empirically established in the field of comparative
psychology in the course of centuries; in the
second place, these facts are tested with an <i>objective
criticism</i>, and systematically distributed; finally, such
rational conclusions are drawn from them on the chief
general questions of psychology as are in harmony
with the fundamental principles of modern monism.
The first volume of Romanes&rsquo;s work bears the title of
<i>Mental Evolution in the Animal World</i>; it presents, in
natural connection, the entire length of the chain of
psychic evolution in the animal world, from the simplest
sensations and instincts of the lowest animals to the
elaborate phenomena of consciousness and reason in
the highest. It contains also a number of extracts
from a manuscript which Darwin left &ldquo;on instinct,&rdquo;
and a complete collection of all that he wrote in the
province of psychology.</p>

<p>The second and more important volume of Romanes&rsquo;s
work treats of &ldquo;Mental evolution in man and the origin
of human faculties.&rdquo; The distinguished psychologist
gives a convincing proof in it &ldquo;that the psychological
barrier between man and the brute has been overcome.&rdquo;
Man&rsquo;s power of conceptual thought and of abstraction
has been gradually evolved from the non-conceptual
stages of thought and ideation in the nearest related
mammals. Man&rsquo;s highest mental powers&mdash;reason,
speech, and conscience&mdash;have arisen from the lower
stages of the same faculties in our primate ancestors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
(the simiæ and prosimiæ). Man has no single mental
faculty which is his exclusive prerogative. His whole
psychic life differs from that of the nearest related mammals
only in degree, and not in kind; quantitatively,
not qualitatively.</p>

<p>I recommend those of my readers who are interested
in these momentous questions of psychology to study
the profound work of Romanes. I am completely at
one with him and Darwin in almost all their views and
convictions. Wherever an apparent discrepancy is
found between these authors and my earlier productions,
it is either a case of imperfect expression on my
part or an unimportant difference in application of
principle. For the rest, it is characteristic of this
&ldquo;science of ideas&rdquo; that the most eminent philosophers
hold entirely antagonistic views on its fundamental
notions.</p>

<p>The great progress which psychology has made, with
the assistance of evolution, in the latter half of
the century culminates in the recognition of <i>the psychological
unity of the organic world</i>. Comparative psychology,
in co-operation with the ontogeny and phylogeny
of the <i>psyche</i>, has enforced the conviction that
organic life in all its stages, from the simplest unicellular
protozoon up to man, springs from the same elementary
forces of nature, from the physiological functions
of sensation and movement. The future task of
scientific psychology, therefore, is not, as it once was,
the exclusively subjective and introspective analysis
of the highly developed mind of a philosopher, but the
objective, comparative study of the long gradation by
which man has slowly arisen through a vast series of
lower animal conditions. This great task of separat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>ing
the different steps in the psychological ladder, and
proving their unbroken phylogenetic connection, has
only been seriously attempted during the last ten years,
especially in the splendid work of Romanes. We must
confine ourselves here to a brief discussion of a few of
the general questions which that gradation has suggested.</p>

<p>All the phenomena of the psychic life are, without
exception, bound up with certain material changes in
the living substance of the body, the <i>protoplasm</i>. We
have given to that part of the protoplasm which seems
to be the indispensable substratum of psychic life the
name of <i>psychoplasm</i> (the &ldquo;soul-substance,&rdquo; in the
monistic sense); in other words, we do not attribute
any peculiar &ldquo;essence&rdquo; to it, but we consider the <i>psyche</i>
to be merely <i>a collective idea of all the psychic functions
of protoplasm</i>. In this sense the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; is merely a
physiological abstraction like &ldquo;assimilation&rdquo; or &ldquo;generation.&rdquo;
In man and the higher animals, in accordance
with the division of labor of the organs and tissues, the
psychoplasm is a differentiated part of the nervous system,
the <i>neuroplasm</i> of the ganglionic cells and their
fibres. In the lower animals, however, which have no
special nerves and organs of sense, and in the plants,
the psychoplasm has not yet reached an independent
differentiation. Finally, in the unicellular protists,
the psychoplasm is identified either with the whole of
the living protoplasm of the simple cell or with a portion
of it. In all cases, in the lowest as well as the
highest stages of the psychological hierarchy, a certain
chemical composition and a certain physical activity
of the psychoplasm are indispensable before the
&ldquo;soul&rdquo; can function or act. That is equally true of
the elementary psychic function of the plasmatic sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>sation
and movement of the protozoa, and of the complex
functions of the sense-organs and the brain in the
higher animals and man. The activity of the psychoplasm,
which we call the &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; is always connected
with metabolism.</p>

<p>All living organisms, without exception, are sensitive;
they are influenced by the condition of their environment,
and react thereon by certain modifications
in their own structure. Light and heat, gravity and
electricity, mechanical processes and chemical action
in the environment, act as <i>stimuli</i> on the sensitive psychoplasm,
and effect changes in its molecular composition.
We may distinguish the following five chief
stages of this sensibility:</p>

<p>I. At the lowest stage of organization the <i>whole
psychoplasm</i>, as such, is sensitive, and reacts on the
stimuli from without; that is the case with the lowest
protists, with many plants, and with some of the most
rudimentary animals.</p>

<p>II. At the second stage very simple and undiscriminating
<i>sense-organs</i> begin to appear on the surface
of the organism, in the form of protoplasmic filaments
and pigment spots, the forerunners of the nerves
of touch and the eyes; these are found in some of the
higher protists and in many of the lower animals and
plants.</p>

<p>III. At the third stage <i>specific organs</i> of sense, each
with a peculiar adaptation, have arisen by differentiation
out of these rudimentary processes: there are the
chemical instruments of smell and taste, and the physical
organs of touch, temperature, hearing, and sight.
The &ldquo;specific energy&rdquo; of these sense-organs is not an
original inherent property of theirs, but has been gained
by functional adaptation and progressive heredity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>IV. The fourth stage is characterized by the <i>centralization</i>
or integration of the <i>nervous system</i>, and,
consequently, of sensation; by the association of the
previously isolated or localized sensations presentations
arise, though they still remain unconscious. That
is the condition of many both of the lower and the
higher animals.</p>

<p>V. Finally, at the fifth stage, the highest psychic
function, <i>conscious perception</i>, is developed by the mirroring
of the sensations in a central part of the nervous
system, as we find in man and the higher vertebrates,
and probably in some of the higher invertebrates, notably
the articulata.</p>

<p>All living organisms without exception have the
faculty of <i>spontaneous movement</i>, in contradistinction
to the rigidity and inertia of unorganized substances
(<i>e.g.</i>, crystals); in other words, certain changes of place
of the particles occur in the living psychoplasm from
internal causes, which have their source in its own
chemical composition. These active vital movements
are partly discovered by direct observation and partly
only known indirectly, by inference from their effects.
We may distinguish five stages of them.</p>

<p>I. At the lowest stage of organic life, in the chromacea,
and many protophyta and lower metaphyta,
we perceive only those <i>movements of growth</i> which are
common to all organisms. They are usually so slow
that they cannot be directly observed; they have to be
inferred from their results&mdash;from the change in size and
form of the growing organism.</p>

<p>II. Many protists, particularly unicellular algæ of
the groups of diatomacea and desmidiacea, accomplish
a kind of creeping or swimming motion by <i>secretion</i>, by
ejecting a slimy substance at one side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>III. Other organisms which float in water&mdash;for instance,
many of the radiolaria, siphonophora, ktenophora,
and others&mdash;ascend and descend by altering
their <i>specific gravity</i>, sometimes by osmosis, sometimes
by the separation or squeezing-out of air.</p>

<p>IV. Many plants, especially the sensitive plants
(mimosa) and other papilionacea, effect movements of
their leaves or other organs by <i>change of pressure</i>&mdash;that
is, they alter the strain of the protoplasm, and,
consequently, its pressure on the enclosing elastic
walls of the cells.</p>

<p>V. The most important of all organic movements
are the <i>phenomena of contraction</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, changes of form
at the surface of the organism, which are dependent on
a twofold displacement of their elements; they always
involve two different conditions or phases of motion&mdash;contraction
and expansion. Four different forms of
this plasmatic contraction may be enumerated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Am&oelig;boid movement (in rhizopods, blood-cells, pigment-cells, etc.).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A similar flow of protoplasm within enclosed cells.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Vibratory motion (ciliary movements) in infusoria, spermatozoa, ciliated epithelial cells.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Muscular movement (in most animals).</p></blockquote>

<p>The elementary psychic activity that arises from the
combination of sensation and movement is called <i>reflex</i>
(in the widest sense), reflective function, or <i>reflex action</i>.
The movement&mdash;no matter what kind it is&mdash;seems in
this case to be the immediate result of the <i>stimulus</i>
which evoked the sensation; it has, on that account,
been called stimulated motion in its simplest form (in
the protists). All living protoplasm has this feature
of irritability. Any physical or chemical change in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the environment may, in certain circumstances, act as
a stimulus on the psychoplasm, and elicit or &ldquo;release&rdquo;
a movement. We shall see later on how this important
physical concept of &ldquo;releasing&rdquo; directly connects
the simplest organic reflex actions with similar mechanical
phenomena of movement in the inorganic
world (for instance, in the explosion of powder by a
spark, or of dynamite by a blow). We may distinguish
the following seven stages in the scale of reflex action:</p>

<p>I. At the lowest stage of organization, in the lowest
protists, the stimuli of the outer world (heat, light,
electricity, etc.) cause in the indifferent protoplasm
only those indispensable movements of growth and
nutrition which are common to all organisms, and are
absolutely necessary for their preservation. That is
also the case in most of the plants.</p>

<p>II. In the case of many freely moving protists (especially
the am&oelig;ba, the heliozoon, and the rhizopod)
the stimuli from without produce on every spot of the
unprotected surface of the unicellular organism external
movements which take the form of changes of shape,
and sometimes changes of place (am&oelig;boid movement,
pseudopod formation, the extension and withdrawal of
what look like feet); these indefinite, variable processes
of the protoplasm are not yet permanent organs. In
the same way, general organic irritability takes the
form of indeterminate reflex action in the sensitive
plants and the lowest metazoa; in many multicellular
organisms the stimuli may be conducted from one cell
to another, as all the cells are connected by fine fibres.</p>

<p>III. Many protists, especially the more highly developed
protozoa, produce on their unicellular body
two little organs of the simplest character&mdash;an organ
of touch and an organ of movement. Both these in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>struments
are direct external projections of protoplasm;
the stimulus, which alights on the first, is immediately
conducted to the other by the psychoplasm of the unicellular
body, and causes it to contract. This phenomenon
is particularly easy to observe, and even produce
experimentally, in many of the stationary infusoria
(for instance, the <i>poteriodendron</i> among the flagellata,
and the <i>vorticella</i> among the ciliata). The faintest
stimulus that touches the extremely sensitive hairs,
or <i>cilia</i>, at the free end of the cells, immediately causes
a contraction of a thread-like stalk at the other, fixed
end. This phenomenon is known as a &ldquo;simple reflex
arch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>IV. These phenomena of the unicellular organism
of the infusoria lead on to the interesting mechanism
of the neuro-muscular cells, which we find in the multicellular
body of many of the lower metazoa, especially
in the cnidaria (polyps and corals). Each single neuro-muscular
cell is a &ldquo;unicellular reflex organ&rdquo;; it has
on its surface a sensitive spot, and a motor muscular
fibre inside at the opposite end; the latter contracts
as soon as the former is stimulated.</p>

<p>V. In other cnidaria, notably in the free swimming
medusæ&mdash;which are closely related to the stationary
polyps&mdash;the simple neuro-muscular cell becomes two
different cells, connected by a filament; an external
<i>sense-cell</i> (in the outer skin) and an internal <i>muscular
cell</i> (under the skin). In this <i>bicellular reflex organ</i> the
one cell is the rudimentary organ of sensation, the other
of movement; the connecting bridge of the psychoplasmic
filament conducts the stimulus from one to
the other.</p>

<p>VI. The most important step in the gradual construction
of the reflex mechanism is the division into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
three cells; in the place of the simple connecting bridge
we spoke of there appears a third independent cell, the
<i>soul-cell</i>, or ganglionic cell; with it appears also a new
psychic function, <i>unconscious presentation</i>, which has
its seat in this cell. The stimulus is first conducted
from the sensitive cell to this intermediate presentative
or psychic cell, and then issued from this to the motor
muscular cell as a mandate of movement. These <i>tricellular
reflex organs</i> are preponderantly developed in
the great majority of the invertebrates.</p>

<p>VII. Instead of this arrangement we find in most
of the vertebrates a <i>quadricellular reflex organ</i>, two distinct
&ldquo;soul-cells,&rdquo; instead of one, being inserted between
the sensitive cell and the motor cell. The external
stimulus, in this case, is first conducted centripetally
to the sensitive cell (the sensible psychic cell),
from this to the <i>will-cell</i> (the motor psychic cell), and
from this, finally, to the contractile muscular cell. When
many such reflex organs combine and new psychic
cells are interposed we have the intricate reflex mechanism
of man and the higher vertebrates.</p>

<p>The important distinction which we make, in morphology
and physiology, between unicellular and multicellular
organisms holds good for their elementary
psychic activity, reflex action. In the unicellular
protists (both the plasmodomous primitive plants, or
<i>protophyta</i>, and the plasmophagous primitive animals,
or <i>protozoa</i>) the whole physical process of reflex action
takes place in the protoplasm of one single cell; their
&ldquo;cell-soul&rdquo; seems to be a unifying function of the psychoplasm
of which the various phases only begin to
be seen separately when the differentiation of special
organs sets in.</p>

<p>The second stage of psychic activity, compound re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>flex
action, begins with the cenobitic protists (<i>v.g.</i>, the
volvox and the carchesium). The innumerable social
cells, which make up this cell-community or c&oelig;nobium,
are always more or less connected, often directly
connected by filamentous bridges of protoplasm. A
stimulus that alights on one or more cells of the community
is communicated to the rest by means of the
connecting fibres, and may produce a general contraction.
This connection is found, also, in the tissues
of the multicellular animals and plants. It was erroneously
believed at one time that the cells of vegetal
tissue were completely isolated from each other, but
we have now discovered fine filaments of protoplasm
throughout, which penetrate the thick membranes of
the cells, and maintain a material and psychological
communication between their living plasmic contents.
That is the explanation of the mimosa: when the
tread of the passer-by shakes the root of the plant, the
stimulus is immediately conveyed to all the cells, and
causes a general contraction of its tender leaves and a
drooping of the stems.</p>

<p>An important and universal feature of all reflex phenomena
is the absence of consciousness. For reasons
which we shall give in the <a href="#CHAPTER_X">tenth chapter</a> we only admit
the presence of consciousness in man and the
higher animals, not in plants, the lower animals, and
the protists; consequently all stimulated movements
in the latter must be regarded as reflex&mdash;that is, all
movements which are not <i>spontaneous</i>, not the outcome
of internal causes (impulsive and automatic
movements).<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It is different with the higher animals
which have developed a centralized nervous system and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
elaborate sense-organs. In these cases consciousness
has been gradually evolved from the psychic reflex activity,
and now conscious, voluntary action appears, in
opposition to the still continuing reflex action below.
However, we must distinguish two different processes,
as we did in the question of instinct&mdash;primary and secondary
reflex action. Primary reflex actions are those
which have never reached the stage of consciousness in
phyletic development, and thus preserve the primitive
character (by heredity from lower animal forms). Secondary
reflex actions are those which were conscious,
voluntary actions in our ancestors, but which afterwards
became unconscious from habit or the lapse of consciousness.
It is impossible to draw a hard and fast line in
such cases between conscious and unconscious psychic
function.</p>

<p>Older psychologists (Herbart, for instance) considered
&ldquo;presentation&rdquo; to be the fundamental psychic phenomenon,
from which all the others are derived. Modern
comparative psychology endorses this view in so
far as it relates to the idea of <i>unconscious</i> presentation;
but it considers <i>conscious</i> presentation to be a secondary
phenomenon of mental life, which is entirely wanting
in plants and the lower animals, and is only developed
in the higher animals. Among the many contradictory
definitions which psychologists have given of &ldquo;presentation,&rdquo;
we think the best is that which makes it consist
in an internal picture of the external object which is
given us in sensation&mdash;an &ldquo;idea,&rdquo; in the broader sense.
We may distinguish the following four stages in the
rising scale of presentative function:</p>

<p>I. <i>Cellular presentation.</i>&mdash;At the lowest stages we
find presentation to be a general physiological property
of psychoplasm; even in the simplest unicellular protist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
sensations may leave a permanent trace in the psychoplasm,
and these may be reproduced by memory. In
more than four thousand kinds of radiolaria, which I
have described, every single species is distinguished by
special, hereditary skeletal structure. The construction
of this specific, and often highly elaborate, skeleton
by a cell of the simplest description (generally globular)
is only intelligible when we attribute the faculty of presentation,
and, indeed, of a special reproduction of the
plastic &ldquo;feeling of distance,&rdquo; to the constructive protoplasm&mdash;as
I have pointed out in my <i>Psychology of the
Radiolaria</i>.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>II. <i>Histionic presentation.</i>&mdash;In the c&oelig;nobia or cell-colonies
of the social protists, and still better in the
tissues of plants and lower, nerveless animals (sponges,
polyps, etc.), we find the second stage of unconscious
presentation, which consists of the common psychic activity
of a number of closely connected cells. If a single
stimulus may, instead of simply spending itself in the
reflex movement of an organ (the leaf of a plant, for instance,
or the arm of a polyp), leave a permanent impression,
which can be spontaneously reproduced later
on, we are bound to assume, in explaining the phenomenon,
a histionic presentation, dependent on the psychoplasm
of the associated tissue-cells.</p>

<p>III. <i>Unconscious presentation in the ganglionic cells.</i>&mdash;This
third and higher stage of presentation is the
commonest form the function takes in the animal world;
it seems to be a localization of presentation in definite
&ldquo;soul-cells.&rdquo; In its simplest form it appears at the sixth
stage of reflex action, when the tricellular reflex organ
arises: the seat of presentation is then the intermediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
psychic cell, which is interposed between the sensitive
cell and the muscular cell. With the increasing development
of the animal nervous system and its progressive
differentiation and integration, this unconscious
presentation also rises to higher stages.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Conscious presentation in the cerebral cells.</i>&mdash;With
the highest stage of development of the animal
organization consciousness arises, as a special function
of a certain central organ of the nervous system. As
the presentations are conscious, and as special parts of
the brain arise for the association of these conscious
presentations, the organism is qualified for those highest
psychic functions which we call thought and reflection,
intellect and reason. Although the tracing of the phyletic
barrier between the older, unconscious, and the
younger, conscious, presentation is extremely difficult,
we can affirm, with some degree of probability, that the
evolution of the latter from the former was <i>polyphyletic</i>;
because we find conscious and rational thought, not
only in the highest forms of the vertebrate stem (man,
mammals, birds, and a part of the lower vertebrates),
but also in the most highly developed representatives of
other animal groups (ants and other insects, spiders and
the higher crabs among the articulata, cephalopods
among the mollusca).</p>

<p>The evolutionary scale of memory is closely connected
with that of presentation; this extremely important
function of the psychoplasm&mdash;the condition of all further
psychic development&mdash;consists essentially in the
<i>reproduction of presentations</i>. The impressions in the
bioplasm, which the stimulus produced as sensations,
and which became presentations in remaining, are revived
by memory; they pass from potentiality to actuality.
The latent potential energy of the psychoplasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
is transformed into kinetic energy. We may distinguish
four stages in the upward development of memory,
corresponding to the four stages of presentation.</p>

<p>I. <i>Cellular memory.</i>&mdash;Thirty years ago Ewald Hering
showed &ldquo;memory to be a general property of organized
matter&rdquo; in a thoughtful work, and indicated the
great significance of this function, &ldquo;to which we owe
almost all that we are and have.&rdquo; Six years later, in
my work on <i>The Perigenesis of the Plastidule, or the Undulatory
Origin of the Parts of Life: an Experiment in
the Mechanical Explanation of Elementary Evolutionary
Processes</i>, I developed these ideas, and endeavored to
base them on the principles of evolution. I have attempted
to show in that work that unconscious memory
is a universal and very important function of all
<i>plastidules</i>; that is, of those hypothetical molecules, or
groups of molecules, which Naegeli has called <i>micellae</i>,
others <i>bioplasts</i>, and so forth. Only <i>living</i> plastidules,
as individual molecules of the active protoplasm, are reproductive,
and so gifted with memory; that is the
chief difference between the organic and inorganic
worlds. It might be stated thus: &ldquo;Heredity is the
memory of the plastidule, while variability is its comprehension.&rdquo;
The elementary memory of the unicellular
protist is made up of the molecular memory of the
plastidules or <i>micellae</i>, of which its living cell-body is
constructed. As regards the extraordinary performances
of unconscious memory in these unicellular protists,
nothing could be more instructive than the infinitely
varied and regular formation of their defensive
apparatus, their shells and skeletons; in particular,
the diatomes and cosmaria among the protophytes, and
the radiolaria and thalamophora among the protozoa,
afford an abundance of most interesting illustrations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
In many thousand species of these protists the specific
form which is inherited is <i>relatively constant</i>, and proves
the fidelity of their unconscious cellular memory.</p>

<p>II. <i>Histionic memory.</i>&mdash;Equally interesting examples
of the second stage of memory, the unconscious
memory of tissues, are found in the heredity of the individual
organs of plants and the lower, nerveless animals
(sponges, etc.). This second stage seems to be <i>a
reproduction of the histionic presentations</i>, that association
of cellular presentations which sets in with the
formation of c&oelig;nobia in the social protists.</p>

<p>III. In the same way we must regard the third stage,
the unconscious memory of those animals which have
a nervous system, as a reproduction of the corresponding
&ldquo;unconscious presentations&rdquo; which are stored up
in certain ganglionic cells. In most of the lower animals
all memory is unconscious. Moreover, even in
man and the higher animals, to whom we must ascribe
consciousness, the daily acts of unconscious memory
are much more numerous and varied than those of the
conscious faculty; we shall easily convince ourselves
of that if we make an impartial study of a thousand
unconscious acts we perform daily out of habit, and
without thinking of them, in walking, speaking, writing,
eating, and so forth.</p>

<p>IV. Conscious memory, which is the work of certain
brain-cells in man and the higher animals, is an
&ldquo;internal mirroring&rdquo; of very late development, the
highest outcome of the same psychic reproduction of
presentations which were mere unconscious processes
in the ganglionic cells of our lower animal ancestors.</p>

<p>The concatenation of presentations&mdash;usually called
the association of ideas&mdash;also runs through a long
scale, from the lowest to the highest stages. This,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
too, is originally and predominantly unconscious (&ldquo;instinct&rdquo;);
only in the higher classes of animals does it
gradually become conscious (&ldquo;reason&rdquo;). The psychic
results of this &ldquo;association of ideas&rdquo; are extremely
varied; still, a very long, unbroken line of gradual development
connects the simplest unconscious association
of the lowest protist with the elaborate conscious
chain of ideas of the civilized man. The <i>unity of consciousness</i>
in man is given as its highest consequence
(Hume, Condillac). All higher mental activity becomes
more perfect in proportion as the normal association
extends to more numerous presentations, and in
proportion to the order which is imposed on them by
the &ldquo;criticism of pure reason.&rdquo; In dreams, where this
criticism is absent, the association of the reproduced
impressions often takes the wildest forms. Even in
the work of the poetic imagination, which constructs
new groups of images by varying the association of
the impressions received, and in hallucinations, etc.,
they are often most unnaturally arranged, and seem
to the prosaic observer to be perfectly irrational. This
is especially true of supernatural &ldquo;forms of belief,&rdquo; the
apparitions of spiritism, and the fantastic notions of
the transcendental dualist philosophy; though it is
precisely these <i>abnormal associations</i> of &ldquo;faith&rdquo; and
of &ldquo;revelation&rdquo; that have often been deemed the greatest
treasures of the human mind (cf. <a href="#CHAPTER_XVI">chap. xvi</a>.).</p>

<p>The antiquated psychology of the Middle Ages
(which, however, still numbers many adherents) considered
the mental life of man and that of the brute to
be two entirely different phenomena; the one it attributed
to &ldquo;reason,&rdquo; the other to &ldquo;instinct.&rdquo; In harmony
with the traditional story of creation, it was assumed
that each animal species had received a definite, un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>conscious
psychic force from the Creator at its formation,
and that this instinct of each species was just as
unchangeable as its bodily structure. Lamarck proved
the untenableness of this error in 1809 by establishing
the theory of Descent, and Darwin completely demolished
it in 1859. He proved the following important
theses with the aid of his theory of selection:</p>

<p>1. The instincts of species show individual differences,
and are just as subject to modification under the
law of <i>adaptation</i> as the morphological features of their
bodily structure.</p>

<p>2. These modifications (generally arising from a
change of habits) are partly transmitted to offspring
by <i>heredity</i>, and thus accumulate and are accentuated
in the course of generations.</p>

<p>3. <i>Selection</i>, both artificial and natural, singles out
certain of these inherited modifications of the psychic
activity; it preserves the most useful and rejects the
least adaptive.</p>

<p>4. The <i>divergence</i> of psychic character which thus
arises leads, in the course of generations, to the formation
of new instincts, just as the divergence of morphological
character gives rise to new species.</p>

<p>Darwin&rsquo;s theory of instinct is now accepted by most
biologists; Romanes has treated it so ably, and so
greatly expanded it in his distinguished work on <i>Mental
Evolution in the Animal World</i>, that I need merely refer
to it here. I will only venture the brief statement
that, in my opinion, there are instincts in <i>all</i> organisms&mdash;in
all the protists and plants as well as in all the animals
and in man; though in the latter they tend to disappear
in proportion as reason makes progress at their
expense.</p>

<p>The two chief classes of instincts to be differentiated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
are the primary and secondary. Primary instincts are
the common lower impulses which are unconscious and
inherent in the psychoplasm from the commencement
of organic life; especially the impulses to self-preservation
(by defence and maintenance) and to the preservation
of the species (by generation and the care of the
young). Both these fundamental instincts of organic
life, <i>hunger</i> and <i>love</i>, sprang up originally in perfect
unconsciousness, without any co-operation of the intellect
or reason. It is otherwise with the <i>secondary</i> instincts.
These were due originally to an intelligent
adaptation, to rational thought and resolution, and to
purposive conscious action. Gradually, however, they
became so automatic that this &ldquo;other nature&rdquo; acted
unconsciously, and, even through the action of heredity,
seemed to be &ldquo;innate&rdquo; in subsequent generations.
The consciousness and deliberation which originally
accompanied these particular instincts of the higher
animals and man have died away in the course of the
life of the plastidules (as in &ldquo;abridged heredity&rdquo;).
The unconscious purposive actions of the higher animals
(for instance, their mechanical instincts) thus
come to appear in the light of innate impulses. We
have to explain in the same way the origin of the &ldquo;<i>à
priori</i> ideas&rdquo; of man; they were originally formed
empirically by his predecessors.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>In the superficial psychological treatises which ignore
the mental activity of animals and attribute to
man only a &ldquo;true soul,&rdquo; we find him credited also with
the exclusive possession of reason and consciousness.
This is another trivial error (still to be found in many
a manual, nevertheless) which the comparative psy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>chology
of the last forty years has entirely dissipated.
The higher vertebrates (especially those mammals
which are most nearly related to man) have just as
good a title to &ldquo;reason&rdquo; as man himself, and within
the limits of the animal world there is the same long
chain of the gradual development of reason as in the
case of humanity. The difference between the reason
of a Goethe, a Kant, a Lamarck, or a Darwin, and that
of the lowest savage, a Veddah, an Akka, a native
Australian, or a Patagonian, is much greater than the
graduated difference between the reason of the latter
and that of the most &ldquo;rational&rdquo; mammals, the anthropoid
apes, or even the papiomorpha, the dog, or the
elephant. This important thesis has been convincingly
proved by the thoroughly critical comparative
work of Romanes and others. We shall not, therefore,
attempt to cover that ground here, nor to enlarge
on the distinction between the reason and the intellect;
as to the meaning and limits of these concepts
philosophic experts give the most contradictory definitions,
as they do on so many other fundamental questions
of psychology. In general it may be said that
the process of the formation of concepts, which is common
to both these cerebral functions, is confined to the
narrower circle of concrete, proximate associations in
the intellect, but reaches out to the wider circle of abstract,
more comprehensive groups of associations in
the work of reason. In the long gradation which connects
the reflex actions and the instincts of the lower
animals with the reason of the highest, intellect precedes
the latter. And there is the fact, of great importance
to our whole psychological treatise, that even
these highest of our mental faculties are just as much
subject to the laws of heredity and adaptation as are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
their respective organs; Flechsig pointed out in 1894
that the &ldquo;organs of thought,&rdquo; in man and the higher
mammals, are those parts of the cortex of the brain
which lie between the four inner sense-centres (cf. chapters
<a href="#CHAPTER_X">x</a>. and <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">xi</a>.).</p>

<p>The higher grade of development of ideas, of intellect
and reason, which raises man so much above the brute,
is intimately connected with the rise of language. Still
here also we have to recognize a long chain of evolution
which stretches unbroken from the lowest to the
highest stages. Speech is no more an exclusive prerogative
of man than reason. In the wider sense, it is
a common feature of all the higher gregarious animals,
at least of all the articulata and the vertebrates, which
live in communities or herds; they need it for the purpose
of understanding each other and communicating
their impressions. This is effected either by touch
or by signs, or by sounds having a definite meaning.
The song of the bird or of the anthropoid ape (<i>hylobates</i>),
the bark of the dog, the neigh of the horse, the
chirp of the cricket, the cry of the cicada, are all specimens
of animal speech. Only in man, however, has
that articulate conceptual speech developed which has
enabled his reason to attain such high achievements.
Comparative philology, one of the most interesting
sciences that has arisen during the century, has shown
that the numerous elaborate languages of the different
nations have been slowly and gradually evolved from
a few simple primitive tongues (Wilhelm Humboldt,
Bopp, Schleicher, Steinthal, and others). August
Schleicher, of Jena, in particular, has proved that the
historical development of language takes place under
the same phylogenetic laws as the evolution of other
physiological faculties and their organs. Romanes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
(1893) has expanded this proof, and amply demonstrated
that human speech, also, differs from that of
the brute only in <i>degree</i> of development, not in essence
and kind.</p>

<p>The important group of psychic activities which we
embrace under the name of &ldquo;emotion&rdquo; plays a conspicuous
part both in theoretical and practical psychology.
From our point of view they have a peculiar importance
from the fact that we clearly see in them the
direct connection of cerebral functions with other physiological
functions (the beat of the heart, sense-action,
muscular movement, etc.); they, therefore, prove the
unnatural and untenable character of the philosophy
which would essentially dissociate psychology from
physiology. All the external expressions of emotional
life which we find in man are also present in the higher
animals (especially in the anthropoid ape and the
dog); however varied their development may be, they
are all derived from the two elementary functions of
the <i>psyche</i>, sensation and motion, and from their combination
in reflex action and presentation. To the
province of sensation, in a wide sense, we must attribute
the feeling of <i>like</i> and <i>dislike</i> which determines the
emotion; while the corresponding <i>desire</i> and <i>aversion</i>
(love and hatred), the effort to attain what is liked and
avoid what is disliked, belong to the category of movement.
&ldquo;Attraction&rdquo; and &ldquo;repulsion&rdquo; seem to be the
sources of <i>will</i>, that momentous element of the soul
which determines the character of the individual. The
<i>passions</i>, which play so important a part in the psychic
life of man, are but intensifications of emotion. Romanes
has recently shown that these also are common
to man and the brute. Even at the lowest stage of organic
life we find in all the protists those elementary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
feelings of like and dislike, revealing themselves in
what are called their <i>tropisms</i>, in the striving after light
and darkness, heat or cold, and in their different relations
to positive and negative electricity. On the other
hand, we find at the highest stage of psychic life, in
civilized man, those finer shades of emotion, of delight
and disgust, of love and hatred, which are the mainsprings
of civilization and the inexhaustible sources
of poetry. Yet a connecting chain of all conceivable
gradations unites the most primitive elements of feeling
in the psychoplasm of the unicellular protist with
the highest forms of passion that rule in the ganglionic
cells of the cortex of the human brain. That the latter
are absolutely amenable to physical laws was proved
long ago by the great Spinoza in his famous <i>Statics
of Emotion</i>.</p>

<p>The notion of <i>will</i> has as many different meanings
and definitions as most other psychological notions&mdash;presentation,
soul, mind, and so forth. Sometimes will
is taken in the widest sense as a <i>cosmic attribute</i>, as
in the &ldquo;World as will and presentation&rdquo; of Schopenhauer;
sometimes it is taken in its narrowest sense as
an <i>anthropological attribute</i>, the exclusive prerogative
of man&mdash;as Descartes taught, for instance, who considered
the brute to be a mere machine, without will or sensation.
In the ordinary use of the term, <i>will</i> is derived
from the phenomenon of voluntary movement, and is
thus regarded as a psychic attribute of most animals.
But when we examine the will in the light of comparative
physiology and evolution, we find&mdash;as we do in the
case of sensation&mdash;that it is a universal property of living
psychoplasm. The automatic and the reflex movements
which we observe everywhere, even in the unicellular
protists, seem to be the outcome of inclinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
which are inseparably connected with the very idea of
life. Even in the plants and lowest animals these inclinations,
or tropisms, seem to be the joint outcome of
the inclinations of all the combined individual cells.</p>

<p>But when the &ldquo;tricellular reflex organ&rdquo; arises (page
115), and a third independent cell&mdash;the &ldquo;psychic,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ganglionic,&rdquo; cell&mdash;is interposed between the sense-cell
and the motor cell, we have an independent elementary
organ of will. In the lower animals, however, this will
remains <i>unconscious</i>. It is only when consciousness
arises in the higher animals, as the subjective mirror
of the objective, though internal, processes in the neuroplasm
of the psychic cells, that the will reaches that
highest stage which likens it in character to the human
will, and which, in the case of man, assumes in common
parlance the predicate of &ldquo;liberty.&rdquo; Its free dominion
and action become more and more deceptive
as the muscular system and the sense-organs develop
with a free and rapid locomotion, entailing a correlative
evolution of the brain and the organs of thought.</p>

<p>The question of the liberty of the will is the one which
has more than any other cosmic problem occupied the
time of thoughtful humanity, the more so that in this
case the great philosophic interest of the question was
enhanced by the association of most momentous consequences
for practical philosophy&mdash;for ethics, education,
law, and so forth. Emil du Bois-Reymond, who
treats it as the seventh and last of his &ldquo;seven cosmic
problems,&rdquo; rightly says of the question: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>&ldquo;Affecting
everybody, apparently accessible to everybody, intimately
involved in the fundamental conditions of human
society, vitally connected with religious belief, this
question has been of immeasurable importance in the
history of civilization. There is probably no other object
of thought on which the modern library contains so
many dusty folios that will never again be opened.&rdquo;
The importance of the question is also seen in the fact
that Kant put it in the same category with the questions
of the immortality of the soul and belief in God. He
called these three great questions the indispensable
&ldquo;postulates of practical reason,&rdquo; though he had already
clearly shown them to have no reality whatever in the
light of <i>pure</i> reason.</p>

<p>The most remarkable fact in connection with this
fierce and confused struggle over the freedom of the
will is, perhaps, that it has been theoretically rejected,
not only by the greatest critical philosophers, but even
by their extreme opponents, and yet it is still affirmed
to be self-evident by the majority of people. Some of
the first teachers of the Christian Churches&mdash;such as
St. Augustine and Calvin&mdash;rejected the freedom of the
will as decisively as the famous leaders of pure materialism,
Holbach in the eighteenth and Büchner in
the nineteenth century. Christian theologians deny it,
because it is irreconcilable with their belief in the omnipotence
of God and in predestination. God, omnipotent
and omniscient, saw and willed all things from
eternity&mdash;he must, consequently, have predetermined
the conduct of man. If man, with his free will, were
to act otherwise than God had ordained, God would not
be all-mighty and all-knowing. In the same sense
Leibnitz, too, was an unconditional determinist. The
monistic scientists of the last century, especially Laplace,
defended determinism as a consequence of their
mechanical view of life.</p>

<p>The great struggle between the determinist and the
indeterminist, between the opponent and the sustainer
of the freedom of the will, has ended to-day, after more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
than two thousand years, completely in favor of the
determinist. The human will has no more freedom
than that of the higher animals, from which it differs
only in degree, not in kind. In the last century the
dogma of liberty was fought with general philosophic
and cosmological arguments. The nineteenth century
has given us very different weapons for its definitive
destruction&mdash;the powerful weapons which we find in
the arsenal of comparative physiology and evolution.
We now know that each act of the will is as fatally
determined by the organization of the individual and
as dependent on the momentary condition of his environment
as every other psychic activity. The character
of the inclination was determined long ago by
<i>heredity</i> from parents and ancestors; the determination
to each particular act is an instance of <i>adaptation</i>
to the circumstances of the moment wherein the
strongest motive prevails, according to the laws which
govern the statics of emotion. Ontogeny teaches us
to understand the evolution of the will in the individual
child. Phylogeny reveals to us the historical development

<p>The human soul&mdash;whatever we may hold as to
its nature&mdash;undergoes a continual development
throughout the life of the individual. This ontogenetic
fact is of fundamental importance in our monistic psychology,
though the &ldquo;professional&rdquo; psychologists pay
little or no attention to it. Since the embryology of the
individual is, on Baer&rsquo;s principle&mdash;and in accordance
with the universal belief of modern biologists&mdash;the
&ldquo;true torch-bearer for all research into the organic
body,&rdquo; it will afford us a reliable light on the momentous
problems of its psychic activity.</p>

<p>Although, however, this &ldquo;embryology of the soul&rdquo; is
so important and interesting, it has hitherto met with
the consideration it deserves only within a very narrow
circle. Until recently teachers were almost the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
ones to occupy themselves with a part of the problem;
since their avocation compelled them to assist and supervise
the formation of the psychic activity in the child,
they were bound to take a theoretical interest, also, in
the psychogenetic facts that came under their notice.
However, these teachers, for the most part, both in recent
and in earlier times, were dominated by the current
dualistic psychology&mdash;in so far as they reflected at
all; and they were totally ignorant of the important
facts of comparative psychology, and unacquainted
with the structure and function of the brain. Moreover,
their observations only extended to children in
their school-days, or in the years immediately preceding.
The remarkable phenomena which the individual
psychogeny of the child offers in its earliest years,
and which are the joy and admiration of all thoughtful
parents, were scarcely ever made the subject of serious
scientific research. Wilhelm Preyer was the pioneer
of this study in his interesting work on <i>The Mind of the
Child</i> (1881). To obtain a perfectly clear knowledge of
the matter, however, we must go further back still;
we must commence at the first appearance of the soul
in the impregnated ovum.</p>

<p>The origin of the human individual&mdash;body and soul&mdash;was
still wrapped in complete mystery at the beginning
of the nineteenth century. Caspar Friedrich Wolff
had, it is true, discovered the true character of embryonic
development in 1759, in his <i>theoria generationis</i>,
and proved with the confidence of a critical observer
that there is a true <i>epigenesis</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a series of very remarkable
formative processes&mdash;in the evolution of the
f&oelig;tus from the simple ovum. But the physiologists of
the time, with the famous Albert Haller at their head,
flatly refused to entertain these empirical truths, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
may be directly proved by microscopic observation, and
clung to the old dogma of &ldquo;preformation.&rdquo; This theory
assumed that in the human ovum&mdash;and in the egg of
all other animals&mdash;the organism was already present,
or &ldquo;preformed,&rdquo; in all its parts; the &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; of
the embryo consisted literally in an &ldquo;unfolding&rdquo; (<i>evolutio</i>)
of the folded organs. One curious consequence
of this error was the theory of <i>scatulation</i>, which we
have mentioned on <a href="#Page_55">p. 55</a>; since the ovary had to be
admitted to be present in the embryo of the woman, it
was also necessary to suppose that the germs of the next
generation were already formed in it, and so on <i>in infinitum</i>.
Opposed to this dogma of the &ldquo;Ovulists&rdquo;
was the equally erroneous notion of the &ldquo;Animalculists&rdquo;;
the latter held that the germ was not really in
the female ovum, but in the paternal element, and that
the store of succeeding generations was to be sought in
the spermatozoa.</p>

<p>Leibnitz consistently applied this theory of scatulation
to the human soul; he denied that either soul or
body had a real development (<i>epigenesis</i>), and said in
his <i>Theodicy</i>: &ldquo;Thus I consider that the souls which
are destined one day to become human exist in the
seed, like those of other species; that they have existed
in our ancestors as far back as Adam&mdash;that is, since the
beginning of the world&mdash;in the forms of organized bodies.&rdquo;
Similar notions prevailed in biology and philosophy
until the third decade of the present century, when
the reform of embryology by Baer gave them their
death blow. In the province of psychology, however,
they still find many adherents; they form one group of
the many curious mystical ideas which give us a living
illustration of the ontogeny of the soul.</p>

<p>The more accurate knowledge which we have recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>ly
obtained, through comparative ethnology, of the various
forms of myths of ancient and modern uncivilized
races, is also of great interest in psychogeny. Still, it
would take us too far from our purpose if we were to
enter into it with any fulness here; we must refer the
reader to Adalbert Svoboda&rsquo;s excellent work on <i>Forms
of Faith</i> (1897). In respect of their scientific and poetical
contents, we may arrange all pertinent <i>psychogenetic
myths</i> in the following five groups:</p>

<p>I. The myth of transmigration.&mdash;The soul lived formerly
in the body of another animal, and passed from
this into a human body. The Egyptian priests, for instance,
taught that the human soul wandered through
all the species of animals after the death of the body,
returning to a human frame after three thousand years
of transmigration.</p>

<p>II. The myth of the in-planting of the soul.&mdash;The
soul existed independently in another place&mdash;a psychogenetic
store, as it were (in a kind of embryonic slumber
or latent life); it was taken out by a bird (sometimes
represented as an eagle, generally as a white stork),
and implanted in the human body.</p>

<p>III. The myth of the creation of the soul.&mdash;God creates
the souls, and keeps them stored&mdash;sometimes in a
pond (living in the form of <i>plankton</i>), according to other
myths in a tree (where they are conceived as the fruit
of a phanerogam); the Creator takes them from the
pond or tree, and inserts them in the human germ during
the act of conception.</p>

<p>IV. The myth of the scatulation of the soul (the theory
of Leibnitz which we have given above).</p>

<p>V. The myth of the division of the soul (the theory
of Rudolph Wagner [1855] and of other physiologists).&mdash;In
the act of procreation a portion is detached from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
both the (immaterial) souls of the parents; the maternal
contribution passes in the ovum, the paternal
in the spermatozoa; when these two germinal cells
coalesce, the two psychic fragments that accompany
them also combine to form a new (immaterial) soul.</p>

<p>Although the poetic fancies we have mentioned as
to the origin of the individual human soul are still widely
accepted, their purely mythological character is now
firmly established. The deeply interesting and remarkable
research which has been made in the course
of the last twenty-five years into the more minute processes
of the impregnation and germination of the ovum
has made it clear that these mysterious phenomena
belong entirely to the province of cellular physiology
(cf. <a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a>). Both the female element, the ovum, and
the male fertilizing body, the sperma or spermatozoa,
are <i>simple cells</i>. These living cells possess a certain
sum of physiological properties to which we give the
title of the &ldquo;cell-soul,&rdquo; just as we do in the permanently
unicellular protist (see <a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a>). Both germinal cells
have the faculty of movement and sensation. The
young ovum, or egg-cell, moves after the manner of an
am&oelig;ba; the minute spermatozoa, of which there are
millions in every drop of the seminal fluid, are ciliated
cells, and swim about as freely in the sperm, by means
of their lashes or <i>cilia</i>, as the ordinary ciliated infusoria
(the flagellata).</p>

<p>When the two cells meet as a result of copulation,
or when they are brought into contact through artificial
fertilization (in the fishes, for instance), they attract
each other and become firmly attached. The
main cause of this cellular attraction is a chemical sensitive
action of the protoplasm, allied to smell or taste,
which we call &ldquo;erotic chemicotropism&rdquo;; it may also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
be correctly (both in the chemical and the romantic
sense) termed &ldquo;cellular affinity&rdquo; or &ldquo;sexual cell-love.&rdquo;
A number of the ciliated cells in the sperm swim rapidly
towards the stationary egg-cell and seek to penetrate
into it. As Hertwig showed in 1875, as a rule only
one of the suitors is fortunate enough to reach the desired
goal. As soon as this favored spermatozoon has
pierced into the body of the ovum with its head (the
nucleus of the cell), a thin mucous layer is detached
from the ovum which prevents the further entrance of
spermatozoa. The formation of this protective membrane
was only prevented when Hertwig kept the ovum
stiff with cold by lowering the temperature, or benumbed
it with narcotics (chloroform, morphia, nicotine, etc.);
then there was &ldquo;super-impregnation&rdquo; or &ldquo;poly-spermy&rdquo;&mdash;a
number of sperm-threads pierced into the body of
the unconscious ovum. This remarkable fact proved
that there is a low degree of &ldquo;cellular instinct&rdquo; (or, at
least, of specific, lively sensation) in the sexual cells
just as effectively as do the important phenomena that
immediately follow in their interior. Both nuclei&mdash;that
of the ovum and of the spermatozoon&mdash;attract each
other, approach, and, on contact, completely fuse together.
Thus from the impregnated ovum arises the
important new cell which we call the &ldquo;stem-cell&rdquo; (<i>cytula</i>),
from the repeated segmentation of which the
whole polycellular organism is evolved.</p>

<p>The psychological information which is afforded by
these remarkable facts of impregnation, which have
only been properly observed during the last twenty-five
years, is supremely important; its vast significance
has hitherto been very far from appreciated. We
shall condense the main conclusions of research in the
following five theses:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>I. Each human individual, like every other higher
animal, is a single simple cell at the commencement
of his existence.</p>

<p>II. This &ldquo;stem-cell&rdquo; (cytula) is formed in the same
manner in all cases&mdash;that is, by the blending or copulation
of two separate cells of diverse origin, the female
ovum and the male spermatozoon.</p>

<p>III. Each of these sexual cells has its own &ldquo;cell-soul&rdquo;&mdash;that
is, each is distinguished by a peculiar
form of sensation and movement.</p>

<p>IV. At the moment of conception or impregnation,
not only the protoplasm and the nuclei of the two sexual
cells coalesce, but also their &ldquo;cell-souls&rdquo;; in other
words, the potential energies which are latent in both,
and inseparable from the matter of the protoplasm,
unite for the formation of a new potential energy, the
&ldquo;germ-soul&rdquo; of the newly constructed stem-cell.</p>

<p>V. Consequently each personality owes his bodily
and spiritual qualities to both parents; by heredity
the nucleus of the ovum contributes a portion of the
maternal features, while the nucleus of the spermatozoon
brings a part of the father&rsquo;s characteristics.</p>

<p>By these empirical facts of conception, moreover,
the further fact of extreme importance is established,
that every man, like every other animal, <i>has a beginning
of existence</i>; the complete copulation of the two
sexual cell-nuclei marks the precise moment when not
only the body, but also the &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; of the new stem-cell
makes its appearance. This fact suffices of itself
to destroy the myth of the immortality of the soul, to
which we shall return later on. It suffices, too, for
the destruction of the still prevalent superstition that
man owes his personal existence to the favor of God.
Its origin is rather to be attributed solely to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>&ldquo;eros&rdquo;
of his parents, to that powerful impulse that is common
to all polycellular animals and plants, and leads to
their nuptial union. But the essential point in this
physiological process is not the &ldquo;embrace,&rdquo; as was
formerly supposed, or the amorousness connected therewith;
it is simply the introduction of the spermatozoa
into the vagina. This is the sole means, in the land-dwelling
animals, by which the fertilizing element can
reach the released ova (which usually takes place in
the uterus in man). In the case of the lower aquatic
animals (fishes, mussels, medusæ, etc.) the mature
sexual elements on both sides are simply discharged
into the water, and their union is let to chance; they
have no real copulation, and so they show none of those
higher psychic &ldquo;erotic&rdquo; functions which play so conspicuous
a part in the life of the higher animals. Hence
it is, also, that all the lower, non-copulating animals
are wanting in those interesting organs which Darwin
has called &ldquo;secondary sexual characters,&rdquo; and which
are the outcome of sexual selection: such are the beard
of man, the antlers of the stag, the beautiful plumage
of the bird of paradise and of so many other birds, together
with other distinctions of the male which are
absent in the female.</p>

<p>Among the above theses as to the physiology of conception
the inheritance of the psychic qualities of the
two parents is of particular importance for psychological
purposes. It is well known that every child
inherits from both his parents peculiarities of character,
temperament, talent, acuteness of sense, and
strength of will. It is equally well known that even
psychic qualities are often (if not always) transmitted
from grandparents by heredity&mdash;often, in fact, a man
resembles his grandparents more than his parents in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
certain respects; and that is true both of bodily and
mental features. All the chief laws of heredity which
I first formulated in my <i>General Morphology</i>, and popularized
in my <i>Natural History of Creation</i>, are just as
valid and universal in their application to psychic phenomena
as to bodily structure&mdash;in fact, they are frequently
more striking and conspicuous in the former
than in the latter.</p>

<p>However, the great province of heredity, to the inestimable
importance of which Darwin first opened our
eyes in 1859, is thickly beset with obscure problems and
physiological difficulties. We dare not claim, even after
forty years of research, that all its aspects are clear
to us. Yet we have done so much that we can confidently
speak of heredity as a <i>physiological function</i> of
the organism, which is directly connected with the faculty
of generation; and we must reduce it, like all other
vital phenomena, to exclusively physical and chemical
processes, to the <i>mechanics of the protoplasm</i>. We now
know accurately enough the process of impregnation
itself; we know that in it the nucleus of the spermatozoon
contributes the qualities of the male parent, and
the nucleus of the ovum gives the qualities of the
mother, to the newly born stem-cell. The blending of
the two nuclei is the &ldquo;physiological moment&rdquo; of
heredity; by it the personal features of both body and
soul are transmitted to the new individual. These
facts of ontogeny are beyond the explanation of the
dualistic and mystic psychology which still prevails
in the schools; whereas they find a perfectly simple interpretation
in our monistic philosophy.</p>

<p>The physiological fact which is most material for a
correct appreciation of individual psychogeny is the <i>continuity</i>
of the <i>psyche</i> through the rise and fall of genera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>tions.
A new individual comes into existence at the
moment of conception; yet it is not an independent
entity, either in respect of its mental or its bodily features,
but merely the product of the blending of the two
parental factors, the maternal egg-cell and paternal
sperm-cell. The cell-souls of these two sexual cells
combine in the act of conception for the formation of a
new cell-soul, just as truly as the two cell-nuclei, which
are the material vehicles of this psychic potential energy,
unite to form a new nucleus. As we now see that
the individuals of one and the same species&mdash;even sisters
born of the same parents&mdash;always show certain
differences, however slight, we must assume that these
variations were already present in the chemical plasmatic
constitution of the generative cells themselves.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>These facts alone would suffice to explain the infinite
variety of individual features, of soul and of bodily
form, that we find in the organic world. As an extreme,
but one-sided, consequence of them, there is the
theory of Weismann, which considers the <i>amphimixis</i>,
or the blending of the germ-plasm in sexual generation,
to be the universal and the sole cause of individual variability.
This exclusive theory, which is connected with
his theory of the continuity of the germ-plasm, is, in
my opinion, an exaggeration. I am convinced, on the
contrary, that the great laws of <i>progressive heredity</i> and
of the correlative <i>functional adaptation</i> apply to the soul
as well as to the body. The new characteristics which
the individual has acquired during life may react to
some extent on the molecular texture of the germ-plasm
in the egg-cell and sperm-cell, and may thus
be transferred to the next generation by heredity in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
certain conditions (naturally, only in the form of latent
energy).</p>

<p>Although in the soul-blending at the moment of conception
only the latent forces of the two parent souls are
transmitted by the coalescence of the erotic cell-nuclei,
still it is possible that the hereditary psychic influence
of earlier, and sometimes very much older, generations
may be communicated at the same time. For the laws
of <i>latent heredity</i> or atavism apply to the soul just as
validly as to the anatomical organization. We find
these remarkable phenomena of reversion in a very simple
and instructive form in the alternation of generations
of the polyps and medusæ. Here we see two very
different generations alternate so regularly that the
first resembles the third, fifth, and so on; while the second
(very different from the preceding) is like the fourth,
sixth, etc. (<i>Natural History of Creation</i>). We do not
find such alternation of generations in man and the
higher animals and plants, in which, owing to continuous
heredity, each generation resembles the next; nevertheless,
even in these cases we often meet with phenomena
of reversion, which must be reduced to the same
law of latent heredity.</p>

<p>Eminent men often take more after their grandparents
than their parents even in the finer shades of
psychic activity&mdash;in the possession of certain artistic
talents or inclinations, in force of character, and in
warmth of temperament; not infrequently there is a
striking feature which neither parents nor grandparents
possessed, but which may be traced a long way back
to an older branch of the family. Even in these remarkable
cases of atavism the same laws of heredity
apply to the <i>psyche</i> and to the physiognomy, to the personal
quality of the sense-organs, muscles, skeleton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and other parts of the body. We can trace them most
clearly in the reigning dynasties and in old families
of the nobility, whose conspicuous share in the life of
the State has given occasion to a more careful historical
picture of the individuals in the chain of generations&mdash;for
instance, in the Hohenzollerns, the princes of
Orange, the Bourbons, etc., and in the Roman Cæsars.</p>

<p>The causal-nexus of <i>biontic</i> (individual) and <i>phyletic</i>
(historical) evolution, which I gave in my <i>General
Morphology</i> as the supreme law at the root of all biogenetic
research, has a universal application to psychology
no less than to morphology. I have fully
treated the special importance which it has with regard
to man, in both respects, in the first chapter of
my <i>Anthropogeny</i>. In man, as in all other organisms,
&ldquo;the embryonic development is an epitome of the historical
development of the species. This condensed
and abbreviated recapitulation is the more complete
in proportion as the original <i>epitomized development</i>
(<i>palingenesis</i>) is preserved by a constant heredity;
on the other hand, it falls off from completeness in
proportion as the later <i>disturbing development</i> (<i>cenogenesis</i>)
is accentuated by varying adaptation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While we apply this law to the evolution of the soul,
we must lay special stress on the injunction to keep
<i>both</i> sides of it critically before us. For, in the case of
man, just as in all the higher animals and plants, such
appreciable perturbations of type (or <i>cenogeneses</i>) have
taken place during the millions of years of development
that the original simple idea of <i>palingenesis</i>, or
&ldquo;epitome of history,&rdquo; has been greatly disturbed and
altered. While, on the one side, the <i>palingenetic</i> recapitulation
is preserved by the laws of like-time and
like-place heredity, it is subject to an essential <i>ceno<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>genetic</i>
change, on the other hand, by the laws of abbreviated
and simplified heredity. That is clearly seen
in the embryonic evolution of the psychic organs, the
nervous system, the muscles, and the sense-organs.
But it applies in just the same manner to the psychic
functions, which are absolutely dependent on the normal
construction of these organs. Their evolution is
subject to great cenogenetic modification in man and
all other viviparous animals, precisely because the complete
development of the embryo occupies a longer time
within the body of the mother. But we have to distinguish
two periods of individual psychogeny: (1) the
embryonic, and (2) the post-embryonic development of
the soul.</p>

<p>I. <i>Embryonic Psychogeny.</i>&mdash;The human f&oelig;tus, or
embryo, normally takes nine months (or two hundred
and seventy days) to develop in the uterus. During
this time it is entirely cut off from the outer world, and
protected, not only by the thick muscular wall of the
womb, but also by the special f&oelig;tal membranes (<i>embryolemmata</i>)
which are common to all the three higher
classes of vertebrates&mdash;reptiles, birds, and mammals.
In all the classes of amniotes these membranes (the
<i>amnion</i> and the <i>serolemma</i>) develop in just the same
fashion. They represent the protective arrangements
which were acquired by the earliest reptiles (<i>proreptilia</i>),
the common parents of all the amniotes, in the
Permian period (towards the end of the palæozoic age),
when these higher vertebrates accustomed themselves
to live on land and breathe the atmosphere. Their
ancestors, the amphibia of the Carboniferous period,
still lived and breathed in the water, like their earlier
predecessors, the fishes.</p>

<p>In the case of these older and lower vertebrates that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
lived in the water, the embryonic development had the
palingenetic character in a still higher degree, as is
the case in most of the fishes and amphibia of the present
day. The familiar tadpole and the larva of the
salamander or the frog still preserve the structure of
their fish-ancestors in the first part of their life in the
water; they resemble them, likewise, in their habits of
life, in breathing by gills, in the action of their sense-organs,
and in other psychic organs. Then, when the
interesting metamorphosis of the swimming tadpole
takes place, and when it adapts itself to a land-life, the
fish-like body changes into that of a four-footed, crawling
amphibium; instead of the gill-breathing in the
water comes an exclusive breathing of the atmosphere
by means of lungs, and, with the changed habits of
life, even the psychic apparatus, the nervous system,
and the sense-organs reach a higher degree of construction.
If we could completely follow the psychogeny
of the tadpole from beginning to end, we should be
able to apply the biogenetic law in many ways to its
psychic evolution. For it develops in direct communication
with the changing conditions of the outer
world, and so must quickly adapt its sensation and
movement to these. The swimming tadpole has not
only the structure but the habits of life of a fish, and
only acquires those of a frog in its metamorphosis.</p>

<p>It is different with man and all the other amniotes;
their embryo is entirely withdrawn from the direct influence
of the outer world, and cut off from any reciprocal
action therewith, by enclosure in its protective
membranes. Besides, the special care of the young
on the part of the amniotes gives their embryo much
more favorable conditions for the cenogenetic abbreviation
of the palingenetic evolution. There is, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
first place, the excellent arrangement for the nourishment
of the embryo; in the reptiles, birds, and monotremes
(the oviparous mammals) it is effected by the
great yellow nutritive yelk, which is associated with
the egg; in the rest of the mammals (the marsupials
and placentals) it is effected by the mother&rsquo;s blood,
which is conducted to the f&oelig;tus by the blood-vessels
of the yelk-sac and the allantois. In the case of the
most highly developed placentals this elaborate nutritive
arrangement has reached the highest degree of
perfection by the construction of a placenta; hence in
these classes the embryo is fully developed before birth.
But its soul remains during all this time in a state of
embryonic slumber, a state of repose which Preyer has
justly compared to the hibernation of animals. We
have a similar long sleep in the chrysalis stage of those
insects which undergo a complete metamorphosis&mdash;butterflies,
bees, flies, beetles, and so forth. This sleep
of the pupa, during which the most important formations
of organs and tissues take place, is the more interesting
from the fact that the preceding condition of
the free larva (caterpillar, grub, or maggot) included
a highly developed psychic activity, and that this is,
significantly, lower than the stage which is seen afterwards
(when the chrysalis sleep is over) in the perfect,
winged, sexually mature insect.</p>

<p>Man&rsquo;s psychic activity, like that of most of the higher
animals, runs through a long series of stages of development
during the individual life. We may single
out the five following as the most important of them:</p>

<p>I. The soul of the new-born infant up to the birth
of self-consciousness and the learning of speech.</p>

<p>II. The soul of the boy or girl up to puberty (<i>i.e.</i>,
until the awakening of the sexual instinct).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>III. The soul of the youth or maiden up to the time
of sexual intercourse (the &ldquo;idealist&rdquo; period).</p>

<p>IV. The soul of the grown man and the mature

of the Mammal Soul</p>

<p>The theory of descent, combined with anthropological
research, has convinced us of the descent of
our human organism from a long series of animal ancestors
by a slow and gradual transformation occupying
many millions of years. Since, then, we cannot
dissever man&rsquo;s psychic life from the rest of his vital
functions&mdash;we are rather forced to a conviction of the
natural evolution of our whole body and mind&mdash;it becomes
one of the main tasks of the modern monistic
psychology to trace the stages of the historical development
of the soul of man from the soul of the brute. Our
&ldquo;phylogeny of the soul&rdquo; seeks to attain this object; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
may also, as a branch of general psychology, be called
<i>phylogenetic</i> psychology, or, in contradistinction to <i>biontic</i>
(individual), <i>phyletic psychogeny</i>. And, although
this new science has scarcely been taken up in earnest
yet, and most of the &ldquo;professional&rdquo; psychologists deny
its very right to existence, we must claim for it the utmost
importance and the deepest interest. For, in our
opinion, it is its special province to solve for us the
great enigma of the nature and origin of the human
soul.</p>

<p>The methods and paths which will lead us to the remote
goal of a complete phylogenetic psychology&mdash;a
goal that is still buried in the mists of the future, and
almost imperceptible to many&mdash;do not differ from those
of other branches of evolutionary research. Comparative
anatomy, physiology, and ontogeny are of the first
importance. Much support is given also by palæontology,
for the order in which the fossil remains of the
various classes of vertebrates succeed each other in the
course of organic evolution reveals to us, to some extent,
the gradual growth of their psychic power as well
as their phyletic connection. We must admit that we
are here, as we are in every branch of phylogenetic research,
driven to the construction of a number of hypotheses
in order to fill up the considerable lacunæ of
empirical phylogeny. Yet these hypotheses cast so
clear and significant a light on the chief stages of historical
development that we are afforded a most gratifying
insight into their entire course.</p>

<p>The comparative psychology of man and the higher
animals enables us to learn from the highest group of
the placentals, the primates, the long strides by which
the human soul has advanced beyond the <i>psyche</i> of the
anthropoid ape. The phylogeny of the mammals and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the lower vertebrates acquaints us with the long series
of the earlier ancestors of the primates which have arisen
within this stem since the Silurian age. All these vertebrates
agree in the structure and development of their
characteristic psychic organ&mdash;the spinal cord. We
learn from the comparative anatomy of the vermalia
that this spinal cord has been evolved from a dorsal <i>acroganglion</i>,
or vertical brain, of an invertebrate ancestor.
We learn, further, from comparative ontogeny that this
simple psychic organ has been evolved from the stratum
of cells in the outer germinal layer, the ectoderm, of the
platodes. In these earliest flat-worms, which have no
specialized nervous system, the outer skin-covering
serves as a general sensitive and psychic organ. Finally,
comparative embryology teaches us that these
simple metazoa have arisen by gastrulation from blastæades,
from hollow spheres, the wall of which is merely
one simple layer of cells, the <i>blastoderm</i>; and the same
science, with the aid of the biogenetic law, explains how
these protozoic c&oelig;nobia originally sprang from the simplest
unicellular organisms.</p>

<p>On a critical study of these different embryonic formations,
the evolution of which from each other we can
directly observe under the microscope, we arrive, by
means of the great law of biogeny, at a series of most
important conclusions as to the chief stages in the development
of our psychic life. We may distinguish
eight of these to begin with:</p>

<p>I. Unicellular protozoa with a simple cell-soul: the
infusoria.</p>

<p>II. Multicellular protozoa with a communal soul:
the catallacta.</p>

<p>III. The earliest metazoa with an epithelial soul:
the platodes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>IV. Invertebrate ancestors with a simple vertical
brain: the vermalia.</p>

<p>V. Vertebrates without skull or brain, with a simple
spinal cord: the acrania.</p>

<p>VI. Animals with skull and brain (of five vesicles):
the craniota.</p>

<p>VII. Mammals with predominant development of the
cortex of the brain: the placentals.</p>

<p>VIII. The higher anthropoid apes and man, with
organs of thought (in the cerebrum): the anthropomorpha.</p>

<p>Among these eight stages in the development of the
human soul we may further distinguish more or less
clearly a number of subordinate stages. Naturally,
however, in reconstructing them we have to fall back
on the same defective evidence of empirical psychology
which the comparative anatomy and physiology of the
actual fauna affords us. As the craniote animals of
the sixth stage&mdash;and these are true fishes&mdash;are already
found fossilized in the Silurian system, we are forced to
assume that the five preceding series of ancestors (which
were incapable of fossilization) were evolved in an earlier,
pre-Silurian age.</p>

<p>I. <i>The cell-soul</i> (<i>or cytopsyche</i>): first stage of phyletic
psychogenesis.&mdash;The earliest ancestors of man and all
other animals were unicellular protozoa. This fundamental
hypothesis of rational phylogeny is based,
in virtue of the phylogenetic law, on the familiar embryological
fact that every man, like every other
metazoon (<i>i.e.</i>, every multicellular organism with tissues),
begins his personal existence as a simple cell,
the stem-cell (<i>cytula</i>), or the impregnated egg-cell
(see <a href="#Page_63">p. 63</a>). As this cell has a &ldquo;soul&rdquo; from the commencement,
so had also the corresponding unicellu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>lar
<i>ancestral forms</i>, which were represented in the oldest
series of man&rsquo;s ancestors by a number of different
protozoa.</p>

<p>We learn the character of the psychic activity of
these unicellular organisms from the comparative
physiology of the protists of to-day. Close observation
and careful experiment have opened out to us in
this respect, in the second half of the nineteenth century,
a new world of the most interesting phenomena.
The best description of them was given by Max Verworn
in his thoughtful work, based on original research,
<i>Psycho-physiological Studies of the Protists</i>.
The work includes also the few earlier observations
of the &ldquo;psychic life of the protist.&rdquo; Verworn came to
the firm conclusion that the psychic processes are unconscious
in all the protists, that the phenomena of
sensation and movement coincide with the molecular
vital processes in their protoplasm, and that their ultimate
causes are to be sought in the properties of the
protoplasmic molecules (the <i>plastidules</i>). &ldquo;Hence the
psychic phenomena of the protists form a bridge that
connects the chemical processes of the inorganic world
with the psychic life of the highest animals; they
represent the germ of the highest psychic phenomena
of the metazoa and of man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The careful observations and many experiments of
Verworn, together with those of Wilhelm Engelmann,
Wilhelm Preyer, Richard Hertwig, and other more
recent students of the protists, afford conclusive evidence
for my &ldquo;theory of the cell-soul&rdquo; (1866). On the
strength of several years of study of different kinds
of protists, especially rhizopods and infusoria, I published
a theory thirty-three years ago to the effect that
every living cell has psychic properties, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
psychic life of the multicellular animals and plants is
merely the sum total of the psychic functions of the
cells which build up their structure. In the lower
groups (in algæ and sponges, for instance) <i>all</i> the cells
of the body have an equal share in it (or with very slight
differences); in the higher groups, in harmony with
the law of the &ldquo;division of labor,&rdquo; only a select portion
of them are involved&mdash;the &ldquo;soul-cells.&rdquo; The important
consequences of this &ldquo;cellular psychology&rdquo; were
partly treated in my work on <i>The Perigenesis of the
Plastidule</i> (1876), and partly in my speech at Munich,
in 1877, on &ldquo;Modern Evolution in Relation to the Whole
of Science.&rdquo; A more popular presentation of them
is to be found in my two Vienna papers (1878) on &ldquo;The
Origin and Development of the Sense-Organs&rdquo; and
on &ldquo;Cell-Souls and Soul-Cells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreover, the cell-soul, even within the limits of the
protist world, presents a long series of stages of development,
from the most simple and primitive to a comparatively
elaborate activity. In the earliest and simplest
protists the faculty of sensation and movement
is equally distributed over the entire protoplasm of the
homogeneous morsel; in the higher forms certain &ldquo;cell-instruments,&rdquo;
or <i>organella</i>, appear, as their physiological
organs. Motor cell-parts of that character are
found in the pseudopodia of the rhizopods, and the vibrating
hairs, lashes, or cilia of the infusoria. The
cell-nucleus, which is wanting in the earlier and lower
protists, is considered to be an internal central organ
of the cell-life. It is especially noteworthy, from a
physiologico-chemical point of view, that the very earliest
protists were plasmodomous, with plant-like nutrition&mdash;hence
<i>protophyta</i>, or primitive plants; from
these came as a secondary stage, by metasitism, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
first plasmophagi, with animal nutrition&mdash;the <i>protozoa</i>,
or primitive animals.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> This metasitism, or circulation
of nutritive matter, implies an important psychological
advance; with it began the development
of those characteristic properties of the animal soul
which are wanting in the plant.</p>

<p>We find the highest development of the animal cell-soul
in the class of ciliata, or ciliated infusoria. When
we compare their activity with the corresponding psychic
life of the higher, multicellular animals, we find
scarcely any psychological difference; the sensitive
and motor <i>organella</i> of these protozoa seem to accomplish
the same as the sense-organs, nerves, and muscles
of the metazoa. Indeed, we have found in the great
cell-nucleus (<i>meganucleus</i>) of the infusoria a central
organ of psychic activity, which plays much the same
part in their unicellular organism as the brain does
in the psychic life of higher animals. However, it is
very difficult to determine how far this comparison is
justified; the views of experts diverge considerably
over the matter. Some take all spontaneous bodily
movement in them to be automatic, or impulsive, and
all stimulated movement to be reflex; others are convinced
that such movements are partly voluntary and
intentional. The latter would attribute to the infusoria
a certain degree of consciousness, and even self-consciousness;
but this is rejected by the others. However
that very difficult question may be settled, it does
not alter the fact that these unicellular protozoa give
proof of the possession of a highly developed &ldquo;cell-soul,&rdquo;
which is of great interest for a correct decision
as to the <i>psyche</i> of our earliest unicellular ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>II. <i>The communal or cenobitic soul</i> (<i>coenopsyche</i>):
second stage of phyletic psychogenesis.&mdash;Individual
development begins, in man and in all other multicellular
animals, with the repeated segmentation of
one simple cell. This <i>stem-cell</i>, the impregnated ovum,
divides first into two daughter cells, by a process of
ordinary indirect segmentation; as the process is repeated
there arise (by equal division of the egg) successively
four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two, sixty-four
such new cells, or &ldquo;blastomeres.&rdquo; Usually (that is,
in the case of the majority of animals) an irregular enlargement
sooner or later takes the place of this original
regular division of cells. But the result is the same
in all cases&mdash;the formation of a (generally spherical)
cluster of heterogeneous (originally homogeneous)
cells. This stage is called the <i>morula</i> (&ldquo;mulberry,&rdquo;
which it somewhat resembles in shape). Then, as
a rule, a fluid gathers in the interior of this aggregate of
cells; it changes into a spherical vesicle; all the cells
go to its surface, and arrange themselves in one simple
layer&mdash;the <i>blastoderm</i>. The hollow sphere which is
thus formed is the important stage of the &ldquo;germinal
vesicle,&rdquo; the <i>blastula</i>, or blastosphere.</p>

<p>The psychological phenomena which we directly
observe in the formation of the blastula are partly
sensations, partly movements, of this community of
cells. The movements may be divided into two groups:
(1) the inner movements, which are always repeated in
substantially the same manner in the process of ordinary
(indirect) segmentation of cells (formation of
the axis of the nucleus, mitosis, karyokinesis, etc.);
(2) the outer movements, which are seen in the
regular change of position of the social cells and
their grouping for the construction of the blastoderm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
We assume that these movements are hereditary and
unconscious, because they are always determined in
the same fashion by heredity from the earlier protist
ancestors. The sensations also fall into two groups:
(1) the sensations of the individual cells, which reveal
themselves in the assertion of their individual independence
and their relation to neighboring cells (with
which they are in contact, and partly in direct combination,
by means of protoplasmic fibres); (2) the
common sensation of the entire community of cells,
which is seen in the individual formation of the <i>blastula</i>
as a hollow vesicle.</p>

<p>The causal interpretation of the formation of the
blastula is given us by the biogenetic law, which explains
the phenomena we directly observe to be the
outcome of heredity, and relates them to corresponding
historical processes which took place long ago in
the origin of the earliest protist-c&oelig;nobia, the blastæads.
But we get a physiological and psychological insight
into these important phenomena of the earliest cell-communities
by observation and experiment on their
modern representatives. Such permanent cell-communities
or colonies are still found in great numbers
both among the plasmodomous primitive plants (for
instance, the paulotomacea, diatomacea, volvocinæ,
etc.) and the plasmophagous primitive animals (the
infusoria and rhizopods). In all these c&oelig;nobia we
can easily distinguish two different grades of psychic
activity: (1) the cell-soul of the individual cells (the
&ldquo;elementary organisms&rdquo;) and (2) the communal soul
of the entire colony.</p>

<p>III. <i>The tissue-soul</i> (<i>histopsyche</i>): third stage of
phyletic psychogenesis.&mdash;In all multicellular, tissue-forming
plants (<i>metaphyta</i>) and in the lowest, nerve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>less
classes of tissue-forming animals (<i>metazoa</i>) we
have to distinguish two different forms of psychic activity&mdash;namely:
(1) the <i>psyche</i> of the individual cells
which compose the tissue, and (2) the <i>psyche</i> of the tissue
itself, or of the &ldquo;cell-state&rdquo; which is made up of the
tissues. This &ldquo;tissue-soul&rdquo; is the higher psychological
function which gives physiological individuality to
the compound multicellular organism as a true &ldquo;cell-commonwealth.&rdquo;
It controls all the separate &ldquo;cell-souls&rdquo;
of the social cells&mdash;the mutually dependent
&ldquo;citizens&rdquo; which constitute the community. This fundamental
twofold character of the <i>psyche</i> in the metaphyta
and the lower, nerveless metazoa is very important.
It may be verified by unprejudiced observation
and suitable experiment. In the first place, each single
cell has its own sensation and movement, and, in
addition, each tissue and each organ, composed of a
number of homogeneous cells, has its special irritability
and psychic unity (<i>e.g.</i>, the pollen and stamens).</p>

<p>A. <i>The plant-soul</i> (<i>phytopsyche</i>) is, in our view, the
summary of the entire psychic activity of the tissue-forming,
multicellular plant (the <i>metaphyton</i>, as distinct
from the unicellular <i>protophyton</i>); it is, however,
the subject of the most diverse opinions even at the
present day. It was once customary to draw an essential
distinction between the plant and the animal, on
the ground that the latter had a &ldquo;soul&rdquo; and the plant
had none. However, an unprejudiced comparison of
the irritability and movements of various higher plants
and lower animals convinced many observers, even at
the beginning of the century, that there must be a
&ldquo;soul&rdquo; on both sides. At a later date Fechner, Leitgeb,
and others strongly contended for the plant-soul.
But a profounder knowledge of the subject was ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>tained
when the similarity of the elementary structure
of the plant and of the animal was proved by the cellular
theory, and especially when the similarity of conduct
of the active, living protoplasm in both was shown
in the plasma theory of Max Schultze (1859). Modern
comparative physiology has shown that the physiological
attitude towards various stimuli (light, heat,
electricity, gravity, friction, chemical action, etc.) of
the &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; portions of many plants and animals
is exactly the same, and that the reflex movements
which the stimuli elicit take place in precisely the same
manner on both sides. Hence, if it was necessary to
attribute this activity to a &ldquo;soul&rdquo; in the lower, nerveless
metazoa (sponges, polyps, etc.), it was also necessary
in the case of many (if not all) metaphyta, at least in the
very sensitive <i>mimosa</i>, the &ldquo;fly-traps&rdquo; (<i>dionaea</i> and
<i>drosera</i>), and the numerous kinds of climbing plants.</p>

<p>It is true that modern vegetal physiology has given
a purely physical explanation of many of these stimulated
movements, or tropisms, by special features of
growth, variations of pressure, etc. Yet these mechanical
causes are neither more nor less <i>psychophysical</i>
than the similar &ldquo;reflex movements&rdquo; of the sponges,
polyps, and other nerveless metazoa, even though
their mechanism is entirely different. The character of
the tissue-soul reveals itself in the same way in both
cases&mdash;the cells of the tissue (the regular, orderly structure
of cells) transmit the stimuli they have received
in one part, and thus provoke movements of other
parts, or of the whole organ. This transmission of
stimuli has as much title to be called &ldquo;psychic activity&rdquo;
as its more complete form in the higher animals with
nerves; the anatomic explanation of it is that the social
cells of the tissue, or cell-community, are not isolated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
from each other (as was formerly supposed), but are
connected throughout by fine threads or bridges of
protoplasm. When the sensitive mimosa closes its
graceful leaves and droops its stalk at contact, or on
being shaken; when the irritable fly-trap (the dionæa)
swiftly clasps its leaves together at a touch, and captures
a fly; the sensation seems to be keener, the transmission
of the stimulus more rapid, and the movement
more energetic than in the reflex action of the stimulated
bath-sponge and many other sponges.</p>

<p>B. <i>The soul of the nerveless metazoa.</i>&mdash;Of very special
interest for comparative psychology in general, and for
the phylogeny of the animal soul in particular, is the
psychic activity of those lower metazoa which have
tissues, and sometimes differentiated organs, but no
nerves or specific organs of sense. To this category
belong four different groups of the earliest c&oelig;lenterates:
(<i>a</i>) the gastræads, (<i>b</i>) the platodaria, (<i>c</i>) the
sponges, and (<i>d</i>) the hydropolyps, the lowest form of
cnidaria.</p>

<p>The <i>gastraeads</i> (or animals with a primitive gut)
form a small group of the lowest c&oelig;lenterates, which
is of great importance as the common ancestral group
of all the metazoa. The body of these little swimming
animals looks like a tiny (generally oval) vesicle,
which has a simple cavity with one opening&mdash;the primitive
gut and the primitive mouth. The wall of the digestive
cavity is formed of two simple layers of cells,
or epithelium, the inner of which&mdash;the gut-layer&mdash;is
responsible for the vegetal activity of nourishment,
while the outer, or skin-layer, discharges the animal
functions of movement and sensation. The homogeneous
sensitive cells of the skin-layer bear long, slender
hairs or lashes (<i>cilia</i>), by the vibration of which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
swimming motion is effected. The few surviving forms
of gastræads, the gastræmaria (<i>trichoplacidae</i>) and cyemaria
(<i>orthonectidae</i>), are extremely interesting, from
the fact that they remain throughout life at a stage
of structure which is passed by all the other metazoa
(from the sponge to man) at the commencement of their
embryonic development. As I have shown in my <i>Theory
of the Gastraea</i> (1872), a very characteristic embryonic
form, the <i>gastrula</i>, is immediately developed from
the <i>blastula</i> in all the tissue animals. The germinal
membrane (blastoderm), which represents the wall of
the hollow vesicle, forms a depression at one side, and
this soon sinks in so deep that the inner cavity of the
vesicle disappears. The half of the membrane which
bends in is thus laid on, and inside, the other half;
the latter forms the <i>skin-layer</i>, or outer germinal layer
(ectoderm or epiblast), and the former becomes the <i>gut-layer</i>,
or inner germinal layer (endoderm or hypoblast).
The new cavity of the cup-shaped body is the digestive
stomach cavity (the <i>progaste</i>), and its opening is the
primitive mouth (or <i>prostoma</i>).<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The skin-layer, or ectoderm,
is the primitive psychic organ in the metazoa;
from it, in all the nerve animals, not only the external
skin and the organs of sense, but also the nervous system,
are developed. In the gastræads, which have no
nerves, all the cells which compose the simple epithelium
of the ectoderm are equally organs of sensation
and of movement; we have here the tissue-soul in its
simplest form.</p>

<p>The platodaria, the earliest and simplest form of the
platodes, seem to be of the same primitive construction.
Some of these cryptoc&oelig;la&mdash;the <i>convoluta</i>, etc.&mdash;have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
no specific nervous system, while their nearest relatives,
the turbellaria, have already differentiated one,
and even developed a vertical brain.</p>

<p>The <i>sponges</i> form a peculiar group in the animal world,
which differs widely in organization from all the other
metazoa. The innumerable kinds of sponges grow, as
a rule, at the bottom of the sea. The simplest form of
sponge, the <i>olynthus</i>, is in reality nothing more than a
<i>gastraea</i>, the body-wall of which is perforated like a
sieve, with fine pores, in order to permit the entrance of
the nourishing stream of water. In the majority of
sponges&mdash;even in the most familiar one, the bath-sponge&mdash;the
bulbous organism constructs a kind of stem or tree,
which is made up of thousands of these gastræads, and
permeated by a nutritive system of canals. Sensation
and movement are only developed in the faintest degree
in the sponges; they have no nerves, muscles, or organs
of sense. It was therefore quite natural that such
stationary, shapeless, insensitive animals should have
been commonly taken to be plants in earlier years.
Their psychic life&mdash;for which no special organs have
been differentiated&mdash;is far inferior to that of the mimosa
and other sensitive plants.</p>

<p><i>The soul of the cnidaria</i> is of the utmost importance
in comparative and phylogenetic psychology; for in this
numerous group of the c&oelig;lenterates the historical evolution
of the <i>nerve-soul</i> out of the <i>tissue-soul</i> is repeated
before our eyes. To this group belong the innumerable
classes of stationary polyps and corals, and of swimming
medusæ and siphonophora. As the common ancestor
of all the cnidaria we can safely assign a very simple
polyp, which is substantially the same in structure
as the common, still surviving, fresh-water polyp&mdash;the
hydra. Yet the hydræ, and the stationary, closely re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>lated
<i>hydropolyps</i>, have no nerves or higher sense-organs,
although they are extremely sensitive. On the
other hand, the free-swimming medusæ, which are developed
from them&mdash;and are still connected with them by
alternation of generations&mdash;have an independent nervous
system and specific sense-organs. Here, also, we
may directly observe the ontogenetic evolution of the
nerve-soul (<i>neuropsyche</i>) out of the tissue-soul (<i>histopsyche</i>),
and thus learn its phylogenetic origin. This
is the more interesting as such phenomena are <i>polyphyletic</i>&mdash;that
is, they have occurred several times&mdash;more
than once, at least&mdash;quite independently. As I have
shown elsewhere, the hydromedusæ have arisen from the
hydropolyps in a different manner from that of the evolution
of the scyphomedusæ from the scyphopolyps;
the gemmation is terminal in the case of the latter, and
lateral with the former. In addition, both groups have
characteristic hereditary differences in the more minute
structure of their psychic organs. The class of siphonophora
is also very interesting to the psychologist. In
these pretty, free-swimming organisms, which come
from the hydromedusæ we can observe a double soul:
the <i>personal soul</i> of the numerous individualities which
compose them, and the common, harmoniously acting
psyche of the entire colony.</p>

<p>IV. <i>The nerve-soul</i> (<i>neuropsyche</i>): fourth stage of
phyletic psychogeny.&mdash;The psychic life of all the higher
animals is conducted, as in man, by means of a more or
less complicated &ldquo;psychic apparatus.&rdquo; This apparatus
is always composed of three chief sections: the <i>organs
of sense</i> are responsible for the various sensations;
the <i>muscles</i> effect the movements; the <i>nerves</i> form the
connection between the two by means of a special central
organ, the brain or ganglion. The arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
and action of this psychic mechanism have been frequently
compared with those of a telegraphic system:
the nerves are the wires, the brain the central, and the
sense-organs subordinate stations. The motor nerves
conduct the commands of the will centrifugally from the
nerve-centre to the muscles, by the contraction of which
they produce the movements: the sensitive nerves transmit
the various sensations centripetally&mdash;that is, from
the peripheral sense-organs to the brain, and thus render
an account of the impressions they receive from the
outer world. The ganglionic cells, or &ldquo;psychic cells,&rdquo;
which compose the central nervous organ, are the most
perfect of all organic elements; they not only conduct
the commerce between the muscles and the organs of
sense, but they also effect the highest performances of
the animal soul, the formation of ideas and thoughts,
and especially consciousness.</p>

<p>The great progress of anatomy, physiology, histology,
and ontogeny has recently added a wealth
of interesting discoveries to our knowledge of the
mechanism of the soul. If speculative philosophy
assimilated only the most important of these significant
results of empirical biology, it would have a very
different character from that it unfortunately presents.
As I have not space for an exhaustive treatment of
them here, I will confine myself to a relation of the chief
facts.</p>

<p>Each of the higher animal species has a characteristic
psychic organ; the central nervous system of
each has certain peculiarities of shape, position, and
composition. The medusæ, among the radiating
cnidaria, have a ring of nervous matter at the border
of the fringe, generally provided with four or eight
ganglia. The mouth of the five-rayed cnidarion is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
girt with a nerve-ring, from which proceed five branches.
The bi-symmetrical <i>platodes</i> and the <i>vermalia</i> have a
vertical brain, or acroganglion, composed of two dorsal
ganglia, lying above the mouth; from these &ldquo;upper
ganglia&rdquo; two branch nerves proceed to the skin and
the muscles. In some of the vermalia and in the mollusca
a pair of ventral &ldquo;lower ganglia&rdquo; are added,
which are connected with the former by a ring round
the gullet. This ring is found also in the <i>articulata</i>;
but in these it is continued on the belly side of the
long body as a ventral medulla, a double fibre like a
rope-ladder, which expands into a double ganglion in
each member. The vertebrates have an entirely different
formation of the psychic organ; they have always
a spinal medulla developed at the back of the
body; and from an expansion of its fore part there
arises subsequently the characteristic vesicular brain.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Although the psychic organs of the higher species
of animals differ very materially in position, form, and
composition, nevertheless comparative anatomy is in
a position to prove a common origin for most of them&mdash;namely,
from the vertical brain of the platodes and
vermalia; they have all, moreover, had their origin
in the outermost layer of the embryo, the <i>ectoderm</i>, or
outer skin-layer. Hence we find the same typical
structure in all varieties of the central nervous organ&mdash;a
combination of ganglionic cells, or &ldquo;psychic cells&rdquo;
(the real active elementary organs of the soul), and of
nerve-fibres, which effect the connection and transmission
of the action.</p>

<p>The first fact we meet in the comparative psychology
of the vertebrates, and which should be the em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>pirical
starting-point of all scientific human psychology,
is the characteristic structure of the central nervous
system. This central psychic organ has a particular
position, shape, and texture in the vertebrate as it has
in all the higher species. In every case we find a spinal
medulla, a strong cylindrical nervous cord, which
runs down the middle of the back, in the upper part of
the vertebral column (or the cord which represents it).
In every case a number of nerves branch off from this
medulla in regular division, one pair to each segment
or vertebra. In every case this medullary cord arises
in the same way in the f&oelig;tus; a fine groove appears
in the middle axis of the skin at the back; then the parallel
borders of this medullary groove are lifted up a
little, bend over towards each other, and form into a
kind of tube.</p>

<p>The long dorsal cylindrical medullary tube which
is thus formed is thoroughly characteristic of the vertebrates;
it is always the same in the early embryonic
sketch of the organism, and it is always the chief feature
of the different kinds of psychic organ which evolve
from it in time. Only one single group of invertebrates
has a similar structure: the rare, marine <i>tunicata</i>,
copelata, ascidia, and thalidiæ. These animals have
other important peculiarities of structure (especially
in the chorda and the gut) which show a striking divergence
from the other invertebrates and resemblance
to the vertebrates. The inference we draw is that both
these groups, the vertebrates and the tunicates, have
arisen from a common ancestral group of the vermalia,
the <i>prochordonia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Still, there is a great difference
between the two classes in the fact that the body of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
tunicate does not articulate, or form members, and has
a very simple organization (most of them subsequently
attach themselves to the bottom of the sea and degenerate).
The vertebrate, on the other hand, is characterized
by an early development of internal members,
and the formation of pro-vertebræ (<i>vertebratio</i>). This
prepares the way for the much higher development of
their organism, which finally attains perfection in man.
This is easily seen in the finer structure of his spinal
cord, and in the development of a number of segmental
pairs of nerves, the spinal nerves, which proceed to the
various parts of the body.</p>

<p>The long ancestral history of our &ldquo;vertebrate soul&rdquo;
commences with the formation of the most rudimentary
spinal cord in the earliest acrania; slowly and gradually,
through a period of many millions of years, it
conducts to that marvellous structure of the human
brain which seems to entitle the highest primate form
to quite an exceptional position in nature. Since a
clear conception of this slow and steady progress of
our phyletic psychogeny is indispensable for a true
psychology, we must divide that vast period into a
number of stages or sections: in each of them the perfecting
of the structure of the nervous centre has been
accompanied by a corresponding evolution of its function,
the <i>psyche</i>. I distinguish eight of these periods
in the phylogeny of the spinal cord, which are characterized
by eight different groups of vertebrates: (1) the
acrania; (2) the cyclostomata; (3) the fishes; (4) the
amphibia; (5) the implacental mammals (monotremes
and marsupials); (6) the earlier placental mammals,
especially the prosimiæ; (7) the younger primates,
the simiæ; and (8) the anthropoid apes and man.</p>

<p>I. First stage&mdash;the <i>acrania</i>: their only modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
representative is the lancelot or amphioxus; the psychic
organ remains a simple medullary tube, and contains
a regularly segmented spinal cord, without brain.</p>

<p>II. Second stage&mdash;the <i>cyclostomata</i>: the oldest group
of the craniota, now only represented by the <i>petromyzontes</i>
and <i>myxinoides</i>: the fore-termination of the
cord expands into a vesicle, which then subdivides
into five successive parts&mdash;the great-brain, intermediate-brain,
middle-brain, little-brain, and hind-brain:
these five cerebral vesicles form the common type from
which the brain of all craniota has evolved, from the
lamprey to man.</p>

<p>III. Third stage&mdash;the <i>primitive fishes</i> (<i>selachii</i>): similar
to the modern shark: in these oldest fishes, from
which all the gnathostomata descend, the more pronounced
division of the five cerebral vesicles sets in.</p>

<p>IV. Fourth stage&mdash;the <i>amphibia</i>. These earliest
land animals, making their first appearance in the Carboniferous
period, represent the commencement of the
characteristic structure of the <i>tetrapod</i> and a corresponding
development of the fish-brain: it advances still
further in their Permian successors, the <i>reptiles</i>, the
earliest representatives of which, the <i>tocosauria</i>, are the
common ancestors of all the amniota (reptiles and birds
on one side, mammals on the other).</p>

<p>V.-VIII. Fifth to the eighth stages&mdash;the <i>mammals</i>.
I have exhaustively treated, and illustrated with a number
of plates, in my <i>Anthropogeny</i>, the evolution of our
nervous system and the correlative question of the development
of the soul. I have now, therefore, merely
to refer the reader to that work. It only remains for
me to add a few remarks on the last and most interesting
class of facts pertaining to this&mdash;to the evolution of
the soul and its organs within the limits of the class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
mammalia. In doing so, I must remind the reader
that the <i>monophyletic origin</i> of this class&mdash;that is, the
descent of all the mammals from one common ancestral
form (of the Triassic period)&mdash;is now fully established.</p>

<p>The most important consequence of the monophyletic
origin of the mammals is the necessity of deriving
the human soul from a long evolutionary series of other
mammal souls. A deep anatomical and physiological
gulf separated the brain structure and the dependent
psychic activity of the higher mammals from those of
the lower: this gulf, however, is completely bridged
over by a long series of intermediate stages. The period
of at least fourteen (more than a hundred, on other
estimates) million years, which has elapsed since the
commencement of the Triassic period, is amply sufficient
to allow even the greatest psychological advance.
The following is a summary of the results of investigation
in this quarter, which has recently been very
penetrating:</p>

<p>I. The brain of the mammal is differentiated from
that of the other vertebrates by certain features, which
are found in all branches of the class; especially by a
preponderant development of the first and fourth vesicles,
the cerebrum and cerebellum, while the third vesicle,
the middle brain, disappears altogether.</p>

<p>II. The brain development of the lowest and earliest
mammals (the monotremes, marsupials, and prochoriates)
is closely allied to that of their palæozoic ancestors,
the Carboniferous amphibia (the <i>stegocephala</i>) and
the Permian reptiles (the <i>tocosauria</i>).</p>

<p>III. During the Tertiary period commences the typical
development of the cerebrum, which distinguishes
the younger mammals so strikingly from the older.</p>

<p>IV. The special development (quantitatively and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
qualitatively) of the cerebrum which is so prominent
a feature in man, and which is the root of his pre-eminent
psychic achievements, is only found, outside
humanity, in a small section of the most highly developed
mammals of the earlier Tertiary epoch, especially
in the anthropoid apes.</p>

<p>V. The differences of brain structure and psychic
faculty which separate man from the anthropoid ape
are slighter than the corresponding interval between
the anthropoid apes and the lower primates (the earliest
simiæ and prosimiæ).</p>

<p>VI. Consequently, the historical, gradual evolution
of the human soul from a long chain of higher and
lower mammal souls must, by application of the universally
valid phyletic laws of the theory of descent,
be regarded as a <i>fact</i> which has been scientifically
proved.</p>

Human Consciousness&mdash;Various Theories: I. Anthropistic

Consciousness&mdash;Formation of Concepts</p>

<p>No phenomenon of the life of the soul is so wonderful
and so variously interpreted as consciousness.
The most contradictory views are current to-day, as they
were two thousand years ago, not only with regard to
the nature of this psychic function and its relation to
the body, but even as to its diffusion in the organic
world and its origin and development. It is more responsible
than any other psychic faculty for the erroneous
idea of an &ldquo;immaterial soul&rdquo; and the belief in
&ldquo;personal immortality&rdquo;; many of the gravest errors
that still dominate even our modern civilization may
be traced to it. Hence it is that I have entitled consciousness
&ldquo;the central mystery of psychology&rdquo;; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
is the strong citadel of all mystic and dualistic errors,
before whose ramparts the best-equipped efforts
of reason threaten to miscarry. This fact would suffice
of itself to induce us to make a special critical
study of consciousness from our monistic point of view.
We shall see that consciousness is simply a natural
phenomenon like any other psychic quality, and that
it is subject to the law of substance like all other natural
phenomena.</p>

<p>Even as to the elementary idea of consciousness, its
contents and extension, the views of the most distinguished
philosophers and scientists are widely divergent.
Perhaps the meaning of consciousness is best
conceived as an <i>internal perception</i>, and compared with
the action of <i>a mirror</i>. As its two chief departments
we distinguish objective and subjective consciousness&mdash;consciousness
of the world, the non-ego, and of the
ego. By far the greater part of our conscious activity,
as Schopenhauer justly remarked, belongs to the consciousness
of the outer world, or the non-ego: this
<i>world-consciousness</i> embraces all possible phenomena
of the outer world which are in any sense accessible to
our minds. Much more contracted is the sphere of
<i>self-consciousness</i>, the internal mirror of all our own
psychic activity, all our presentations, sensations, and
volitions.</p>

<p>Many distinguished thinkers, especially on the physiological
side (Wundt and Ziehen, for instance) take
the ideas of consciousness and psychic function to be
identical&mdash;&ldquo;all psychic action is conscious&rdquo;; the province
of psychic life, they say, is coextensive with that
of consciousness. In our opinion, such a definition
gives an undue extension to the meaning of consciousness,
and occasions many errors and misunder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>standings.
We share, rather, the view of other philosophers
(Romanes, Fritz Schultze, and Paulsen),
that even our unconscious presentations, sensations,
and volitions pertain to our psychic life; indeed,
the province of these unconscious psychic actions
(reflex action, and so forth) is far more extensive
than that of consciousness. Moreover, the two provinces
are intimately connected, and are separated by
no sharp line of demarcation. An unconscious presentation
may become conscious at any moment; let
our attention be withdrawn from it by some other object,
and forthwith it disappears from consciousness
once more.</p>

<p>The only source of our knowledge of consciousness
is that faculty itself; that is the chief cause of the
extraordinary difficulty of subjecting it to scientific
research. Subject and object are one and the same
in it: the perceptive subject mirrors itself in its own
inner nature, which is to be the object of our inquiry.
Thus we can never have a complete objective certainty
of the consciousness of others; we can only proceed
by a comparison of their psychic condition with our
own. As long as this comparison is restricted to <i>normal</i>
people we are justified in drawing certain conclusions
as to their consciousness, the validity of which is
unchallenged. But when we pass on to consider <i>abnormal</i>
individuals (the genius, the eccentric, the stupid,
or the insane) our conclusions from analogy are
either unsafe or entirely erroneous. The same must
be said with even greater truth when we attempt to
compare human consciousness with that of the animals
(even the higher, but especially the lower). In that
case such grave difficulties arise that the views of physiologists
and philosophers diverge as widely as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
poles on the subject. We shall briefly enumerate the
most important of these views.</p>

<p>I. <i>The anthropistic theory of consciousness.</i>&mdash;It is peculiar
to man. To Descartes we must trace the widespread
notion that consciousness and thought are man&rsquo;s
exclusive prerogative, and that he alone is blessed with
an &ldquo;immortal soul.&rdquo; This famous French philosopher
and mathematician (educated in a Jesuit College) established
a rigid partition between the psychic activity
of man and that of the brute. In his opinion the human
soul, a thinking, immaterial being, is completely
separated from the body, which is extended and material.
Yet it is united to the body at a certain point
in the brain (the <i>glandula pinealis</i>) for the purpose of
receiving impressions from the outer world and effecting
muscular movements. The animals, not being endowed
with thought, have no soul: they are mere automata,
or cleverly constructed machines, whose sensations,
presentations, and volitions are purely mechanical,
and take place according to the ordinary laws of
physics. Hence Descartes was a <i>dualist</i> in human
psychology, and a <i>monist</i> in the psychology of the
brute. This open contradiction in so clear and acute
a thinker is very striking; in explaining it, it is not
unnatural to suppose that he concealed his real opinion,
and left the discovery of it to independent scholars.
As a pupil of the Jesuits, Descartes had been taught to
deny the truth in the face of his better insight; and
perhaps he dreaded the power and the fires of the
Church. Besides, his sceptical principle, that every
sincere effort to attain the truth must start with a doubt
of the traditional dogma had already drawn upon him
fanatical accusations of scepticism and atheism. The
great influence which Descartes had on subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
philosophy was very remarkable, and entirely in harmony
with his &ldquo;book-keeping by double entry.&rdquo; The
<i>materialists</i> of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
appealed to the Cartesian theory of the animal soul and
its purely mechanical activity in support of their monistic
psychology. The <i>spiritualists</i>, on the other hand,
asserted that their dogma of the immortality of the soul
and its independence of the body was firmly established
by Descartes&rsquo; theory of the human soul. This view
is still prevalent in the camp of the theologians and
dualistic metaphysicians. The scientific conception
of nature, however, which has been built up in the
nineteenth century, has, with the aid of empirical progress,
in physiological and comparative psychology,
completely falsified it.</p>

<p>II. <i>Neurological theory of consciousness.</i>&mdash;It is present
only in man and those higher animals which have
a centralized nervous system and organs of sense.
The conviction that a large number of animals&mdash;at
least the higher mammals&mdash;are not less endowed than
man with a thinking soul and consciousness prevails
in modern zoology, exact physiology, and the monistic
psychology. The immense progress we have made
in the various branches of biology has contributed to
bring about a recognition of this important truth.
We confine ourselves for the present to the higher vertebrates,
and especially the mammals. That these
most intelligent specimens of these highly developed
vertebrates&mdash;apes and dogs, in particular&mdash;have a
strong resemblance to man in their whole psychic
life has been recognized and speculated on for thousands
of years. Their faculty of presentation and
sensation, of feeling and desire, is so like that of man
that we need adduce no proof of our thesis. But even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the higher associational activity of the brain, the formation
of judgments and their connection into chains
of reasoning, thought, and consciousness in the narrower
sense, are developed in them after the same fashion
as in man: they differ only in degree, not in kind.
Moreover, we learn from comparative anatomy and histology
that the intricate structure of the brain (both in
general and in detail) is substantially the same in the
mammals as it is in man. The same lesson is enforced
by comparative ontogeny with regard to the origin of
these psychic organs. Comparative physiology teaches
us that the various states of consciousness are just
the same in these highest placentals as in man; and
we learn by experiment that there is the same reaction
to external stimuli. The higher animals can be narcotized
by alcohol, chloroform, ether, etc., and may be
hypnotized by the usual methods, just as in the case of
man.</p>

<p>It is, however, impossible to determine mathematically
at what stage of animal life consciousness is to be
first recognized as such. Some zoologists draw the line
very high in the scale, others very low. Darwin, who
most accurately distinguishes the various stages of
consciousness, intelligence, and emotion in the higher
animals, and explains them by progressive evolution,
points out how difficult, or even impossible, it is to determine
the first beginning of this supreme psychic faculty
in the lower animals. Personally, out of the many
contradictory theories, I take that to be most probable
which holds <i>the centralization of the nervous system</i> to
be a condition of consciousness; and that is wanting in
the lower classes of animals. The presence of a central
nervous organ, of highly developed sense-organs, and
an elaborate association of groups of presentations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
seem to me to be required before the unity of consciousness
is possible.</p>

<p>III. <i>Animal theory of consciousness.</i>&mdash;All animals,
and they alone, have consciousness. This theory
would draw a sharp distinction between the psychic
life of the animal and of the plant. Such a distinction
was urged by many of the older writers, and was
clearly formulated by Linné in his celebrated <i>Systema
Naturae</i>; the two great kingdoms of the organic world
are, in his opinion, divided by the fact that animals
have sensation and consciousness, and the plants are
devoid of them. Later on Schopenhauer laid stress on
the same distinction: &ldquo;Consciousness is only known
to us as a feature of animal nature. Even though it
extend upwards through the whole animal kingdom,
even to man and his reason, the unconsciousness of the
plant, from which it started, remains as the basic feature.
In the lowest animals we have but the dawn of
it.&rdquo; The inaccuracy of this view was obvious by about
the middle of the present century, when a deeper study
was made of the psychic activity of the lower animal
forms, especially the c&oelig;lenterates (sponges and cnidaria):
they are undoubtedly animals, yet there is no
more trace of a definite consciousness in them than in
most of the plants. The distinction between the two
kingdoms was still further obliterated when more careful
research was made into their unicellular forms.
There is no psychological difference between the plasmophagous
protozoa and the plasmodomous protophyta,
even in respect of their consciousness.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Biological theory of consciousness.</i>&mdash;It is found
in all organisms, animal or vegetal, but not in lifeless
bodies (such as crystals). This opinion is usually associated
with the idea that all organisms (as distin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>guished
from inorganic substances) have souls: the
three ideas&mdash;life, soul, and consciousness&mdash;are then
taken to be coextensive. Another modification of this
view holds that, though these fundamental phenomena
of organic life are inseparably connected, yet consciousness
is only a part of the activity of the soul, and of the
vital activity. Fechner, in particular, has endeavored
to prove that the plant has a &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; in the same sense
as an animal is said to have one; and many credit the
vegetal soul with a consciousness similar to that of
the animal soul. In truth, the remarkable stimulated
movements of the leaves of the sensitive plants (the mimosa,
drosera, and dionæa), the automatic movements
of other plants (the clover and wood-sorrel, and especially
the hedysarum), the movements of the &ldquo;sleeping
plants&rdquo; (particularly the <i>papilionacea</i>), etc., are strikingly
similar to the movements of the lower animal
forms: whoever ascribes consciousness to the latter
cannot refuse it to such vegetal forms.</p>

<p>V. <i>Cellular theory of consciousness.</i>&mdash;It is a vital property
of every cell. The application of the cellular theory
to every branch of biology involved its extension
to psychology. Just as we take the living cell to be
the &ldquo;elementary organism&rdquo; in anatomy and physiology,
and derive the whole system of the multicellular
animal or plant from it, so, with equal right, we may
consider the &ldquo;cell-soul&rdquo; to be the psychological unit,
and the complex psychic activity of the higher organism
to be the result of the combination of the psychic activity
of the cells which compose it. I gave the outlines
of this <i>cellular psychology</i> in my <i>General Morphology</i>
in 1866, and entered more fully into the subject in my
paper on &ldquo;Cell-Souls and Soul-Cells.&rdquo; I was led to a
deeper study of this &ldquo;elementary psychology&rdquo; by my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
protracted research into the unicellular forms of life.
Many of these tiny (generally microscopic) protists
show similar expressions of sensation and will, and
similar instincts and movements, to those of higher
animals; that is especially true of the very sensitive
and lively infusoria. In the relation of these sensitive
cell-organisms to their environment, and in many other
of their vital expressions (for instance, in the wonderful
architecture of the rhizopods, the thalamophoræ,
and the infusoria), we seemed to have clear indications
of conscious psychic action. If, then, we accept the
biological theory of consciousness (No. IV.), and credit
every psychic function with a share of that faculty, we
shall be compelled to ascribe it to each independent protist
cell. In that case its material basis would be either
the entire protoplasm of the cell, or its nucleus, or a portion
of it. In the &ldquo;psychade theory&rdquo; of Fritz Schultze
the elementary consciousness of the <i>psychade</i> would
have the same relation to the individual cells as personal
consciousness has to the multicellular organism
of the personality in the higher animals and man.
It is impossible definitively to disprove this theory,
which I held at one time. Still, I now feel compelled
to agree with Max Verworn, in his belief that none of
the protists have a developed self-consciousness, but
that their sensations and movements are of an unconscious
character.</p>

<p>VI. <i>Atomistic theory of consciousness.</i>&mdash;It is an elementary
property of all atoms. This atomistic hypothesis
goes furthest of all the different views as to
the extension of consciousness. It certainly escapes
the difficulty which so many philosophers and biologists
experience in solving the problem of the first origin
of consciousness. It is a phenomenon of so pecu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>liar
a character that a derivation of it from other psychic
functions seems extremely hazardous. It seemed,
therefore, the easiest way out of the difficulty to conceive
it as an inherent property of all matter, like gravitation
or chemical affinity. On that hypothesis there
would be as many forms of this original consciousness
as there are chemical elements; each atom of hydrogen
would have its hydrogenic consciousness, each atom
of carbon its carbonic consciousness, and so forth.
There are philosophers, even, who ascribe consciousness
to the four elements of Empedocles, the union of
which, by &ldquo;love and hate,&rdquo; produces the totality of
things.</p>

<p>Personally, I have never subscribed to this hypothesis
of atomic consciousness. I emphasize the point
because Emil du Bois-Reymond has attributed it to
me. In the controversy I had with him (1880) he violently
attacked my &ldquo;pernicious and false philosophy,&rdquo;
and contended that I had, in my paper on &ldquo;The Perigenesis
of the Plastidule,&rdquo; &ldquo;laid it down as a metaphysical
axiom that every atom has its individual consciousness.&rdquo;
On the contrary, I explicitly stated that I
conceive the elementary psychic qualities of sensation
and will, which may be attributed to atoms, to be <i>unconscious</i>&mdash;just
as unconscious as the elementary memory
which I, in company with that distinguished physiologist,
Ewald Hering, consider to be &ldquo;a common function
of all organized matter&rdquo;&mdash;or, more correctly, &ldquo;living
substance.&rdquo; Du Bois-Reymond curiously confuses
&ldquo;soul&rdquo; and &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo;; whether from oversight
or not I cannot say. Since he considers consciousness
to be a transcendental phenomenon (as we shall see
presently), while denying that character to other psychic
functions&mdash;the action of the senses, for example&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
must infer that he recognizes the difference of the two
ideas. Other parts of his eloquent speeches contain
quite the opposite view, for the famous orator not infrequently
contradicts himself on important questions
of principle. However, I repeat that, in my opinion,
consciousness is only <i>part</i> of the psychic phenomena
which we find in man and the higher animals; the
great majority of them are unconscious.</p>

<p>However divergent are the different views as to the
nature and origin of consciousness, they may, nevertheless,
on a clear and logical examination, all be reduced
to two fundamental theories&mdash;the transcendental
(or dualistic) and the physiological (or monistic).
I have myself always held the latter view, in the light
of my evolutionary principles, and it is now shared by
a great number of distinguished scientists, though it
is by no means generally accepted. The transcendental
theory is the older and much more common; it has
recently come once more into prominence, principally
through Du Bois-Reymond, and it has acquired a great
importance in modern discussions of cosmic problems
through his famous &ldquo;Ignorabimus speech.&rdquo; On account
of the extreme importance of this fundamental
question we must touch briefly on its main features.</p>

<p>In the celebrated discourse on &ldquo;The Limits of Natural
Science,&rdquo; which E. du Bois-Reymond gave on
August 14, 1872, at the Scientific Congress at Leipzig,
he spoke of two &ldquo;absolute limits&rdquo; to our possible
knowledge of nature which the human mind will never
transcend in its most advanced science&mdash;<i>never</i>, as the
oft-quoted termination of the address, &ldquo;Ignorabimus,&rdquo;
emphatically pronounces. The first absolutely insoluble
&ldquo;world-enigma&rdquo; is the &ldquo;connection of matter
and force,&rdquo; and the distinctive character of these fun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>damental
natural phenomena; we shall go more fully
into this &ldquo;problem of substance&rdquo; in the <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">twelfth chapter</a>.
The second insuperable difficulty of philosophy is
given as the problem of consciousness&mdash;the question
how our mental activity is to be explained by material
conditions, especially movements, how &ldquo;substance [the
substance which underlies matter and force] comes,
under certain conditions, to feel, to desire, and to think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For brevity, and in order to give a characteristic
name to the Leipzig discourse, I have called it the &ldquo;Ignorabimus
speech&rdquo;; this is the more permissible, as
E. du Bois-Reymond himself, with a just pride, eight
years afterwards, speaking of the extraordinary consequences
of his discourse, said: &ldquo;Criticism sounded
every possible note, from friendly praise to the severest
censure, and the word &lsquo;Ignorabimus,&rsquo; which was the
culmination of my inquiry, was at once transformed
into a kind of scientific shibboleth.&rdquo; It is quite true
that loud praise and approbation resounded in the halls
of the dualistic and spiritualistic philosophy, and especially
in the camp of the &ldquo;Church militant&rdquo;; even
the spiritists and the host of believers, who thought
the immortality of their precious souls was saved by
the &ldquo;Ignorabimus,&rdquo; joined in the chorus. The &ldquo;severest
censure&rdquo; came at first only from a few scientists
and philosophers&mdash;from the few who had sufficient
scientific knowledge and moral courage to oppose the
dogmatism of the all-powerful secretary and dictator
of the Berlin Academy of Science.</p>

<p>Towards the end, however, the author of the &ldquo;Ignorabimus
speech&rdquo; briefly alluded to the question whether
these two great &ldquo;world-enigmas,&rdquo; the general problem
of substance and the special problem of consciousness,
are not two aspects of one and the same problem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
&ldquo;This idea,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is certainly the simplest, and
preferable to the one which makes the world doubly
incomprehensible. Such, however, is the nature of
things that even here we can obtain no clear knowledge,
and it is useless to speak further of the question.&rdquo;
The latter sentiment I have always stoutly contested,
and have endeavored to prove that the two great questions
are not two distinct problems. &ldquo;The neurological
problem of consciousness is but a particular
aspect of the all-pervading cosmological problem of
substance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The peculiar phenomenon of consciousness is not,
as Du Bois-Reymond and the dualistic school would
have us believe, a completely &ldquo;transcendental&rdquo; problem;
it is, as I showed thirty-three years ago, a <i>physiological</i>
problem, and, as such, must be reduced to
the phenomena of physics and chemistry. I subsequently
gave it the more definite title of a <i>neurological</i>
problem, as I share the view that true consciousness
(thought and reason) is only present in those
higher animals which have a centralized nervous system
and organs of sense of a certain degree of development.
Those conditions are certainly found in the
higher vertebrates, especially in the placental mammals,
the class from which man has sprung. The
consciousness of the highest apes, dogs, elephants, etc.,
differs from that of man in degree only, not in kind,
and the graduated interval between the consciousness
of these &ldquo;rational&rdquo; placentals and that of the lowest
races of men (the Veddahs, etc.) is less than the corresponding
interval between these uncivilized races and
the highest specimens of thoughtful humanity (Spinoza,
Goethe, Lamarck, Darwin, etc.). Consciousness
is but a part of the higher activity of the soul, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
such it is dependent on the normal structure of the corresponding
psychic organ, the brain.</p>

<p>Physiological observation and experiment determined
twenty years ago that the particular portion of the
mammal-brain which we call the <i>seat</i> (preferably the
<i>organ</i>) of consciousness is a part of the cerebrum, an
area in the late-developed gray bed, or cortex, which is
evolved out of the convex dorsal portion of the primary
cerebral vesicle, the &ldquo;fore-brain.&rdquo; Now, the morphological
proof of this physiological thesis has been successfully
given by the remarkable progress of the microscopic
anatomy of the brain, which we owe to the
perfect methods of research of modern science (Kölliker,
Flechsig, Golgi, Edinger, Weigert, and others).</p>

<p>The most important development is the discovery of
the <i>organs of thought</i> by Paul Flechsig, of Leipzig; he
proved that in the gray bed of the brain are found the
four seats of the central sense-organs, or four &ldquo;inner
spheres of sensation&rdquo;&mdash;the sphere of touch in the vertical
lobe, the sphere of smell in the frontal lobe, the
sphere of sight in the occipital lobe, and the sphere of
hearing in the temporal lobe. Between these four
&ldquo;sense-centres&rdquo; lie the four great &ldquo;thought-centres,&rdquo;
or centres of association, the <i>real organs of mental life</i>;
they are those highest instruments of psychic activity
that produce thought and consciousness. In front we
have the frontal brain or centre of association; behind,
on top there is the vertical brain, or parietal centre of
association, and underneath the principal brain, or
&ldquo;the great occipito-temporal centre of association&rdquo;
(the most important of all); lower down, and internally,
the insular brain or the insula of Reil, the insular
centre of association. These four &ldquo;thought-centres,&rdquo;
distinguished from the intermediate <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>&ldquo;sense-centres&rdquo;
by a peculiar and elaborate nerve-structure, are the
true and sole organs of thought and consciousness.
Flechsig has recently pointed out that, in the case of
man, very specific structures are found in one part of
them; these structures are wanting in the other mammals,
and they, therefore, afford an explanation of the
superiority of man&rsquo;s mental powers.</p>

<p>The momentous announcement of modern physiology,
that the cerebrum is the organ of consciousness
and mental action in man and the higher mammals,
is illustrated and confirmed by the pathological study
of its diseases. When parts of the cortex are destroyed
by disease their respective functions are affected, and
thus we are enabled, to some extent, to localize the activities
of the brain; when certain parts of the area are
diseased, that portion of thought and consciousness
disappears which depends on those particular sections.
Pathological experiment yields the same result; the
decay of some known area (for instance, the centre of
speech) extinguishes its function (speech). In fact,
there is proof enough in the most familiar phenomena
of consciousness of their complete dependence on chemical
changes in the substance of the brain. Many beverages
(such as coffee and tea) stimulate our powers of
thought; others (such as wine and beer) intensify feeling;
musk and camphor reanimate the fainting consciousness;
ether and chloroform deaden it, and so
forth. How would that be possible if consciousness
were an immaterial entity, independent of these anatomical
organs? And what becomes of the consciousness
of the &ldquo;immortal soul&rdquo; when it no longer has the
use of these organs?</p>

<p>These and other familiar facts prove that man&rsquo;s consciousness&mdash;and
that of the nearest mammals&mdash;is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
<i>changeable</i>, and that its activity is always open to
modification from inner (alimentation, circulation, etc.)
and outer causes (lesion of the brain, stimulation, etc.).
Very instructive, too, are the facts of double and intermittent
consciousness, which remind us of &ldquo;alternate
generations of presentations.&rdquo; The same individual
has an entirely different consciousness on different
days, with a change of circumstances; he does
not know to-day what he did yesterday: yesterday he
could say, &ldquo;I am I&rdquo;; to-day he must say, &ldquo;I am another
being.&rdquo; Such intermittence of consciousness
may last not only days, but months, and even years;
the change may even become permanent.</p>

<p>As everybody knows, the new-born infant has no
consciousness. Preyer has shown that it is only developed
after the child has begun to speak; for a long
time it speaks of itself in the third person. In the important
moment when it first pronounces the word &ldquo;I,&rdquo;
when the feeling of self becomes clear, we have the beginning
of self-consciousness, and of the antithesis to
the non-ego. The rapid and solid progress in knowledge
which the child makes in its first ten years, under
the care of parents and teachers, and the slower progress
of the second decade, until it reaches complete maturity
of mind, are intimately connected with a great advancement
in the growth and development of consciousness
and of its organ, the brain. But even when the pupil
has got his &ldquo;certificate of maturity&rdquo; his consciousness
is still far from mature; it is then that his &ldquo;world-consciousness&rdquo;
first begins to develop, in his manifold
relations with the outer world. Then, in the third decade,
we have the full maturity of rational thought and
consciousness, which, in cases of normal development,
yield their ripe fruits during the next three decades.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
The slow, gradual degeneration of the higher mental
powers, which characterizes senility, usually sets in at
the commencement of the seventh decade&mdash;sometimes
earlier, sometimes later. Memory, receptiveness, and
interest in particular objects gradually decay; though
productivity, mature consciousness, and philosophic
interest in general truths often remain for many years
longer.</p>

<p>The individual development of consciousness in earlier
youth proves the universal validity of the <i>biogenetic
law</i>; and, indeed, it is still recognizable in many ways
during the later years. In any case, the ontogenesis
of consciousness makes it perfectly clear that it is not
an &ldquo;immaterial entity,&rdquo; but a physiological function
of the brain, and that it is, consequently, no exception
to the general law of substance.</p>

<p>From the fact that consciousness, like all other psychic
functions, is dependent on the normal development
of certain organs, and that it gradually unfolds in
the child in proportion to the development of those
organs, we may already conclude that it has arisen
in the animal kingdom by a gradual historical development.
Still, however certain we are of the fact
of this natural evolution of consciousness, we are, unfortunately,
not yet in a position to enter more deeply
into the question and construct special hypotheses in
elucidation of it. Palæontology, it is true, gives us a
few facts which are not without significance. For instance,
the quantitative and qualitative development
of the brain of the placental mammals during the Tertiary
period is very remarkable. The cavity of many
of the fossil skulls of the period has been carefully examined,
and has given us a good deal of reliable information
as to the size, and, to some extent, as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
structure, of the brain they enclosed. We find, within
the limits of one and the same group (the ungulates,
the rodents, or the primates), a marked advance in the
later miocene and pliocene specimens as compared with
the earlier eocene and oligocene representatives of the
same stem; in the former the brain (in proportion to
the size of the organism) is six to eight times as large
as in the latter.</p>

<p>Moreover, that highest stage of consciousness, which
is reached by man alone, has been evolved step by
step&mdash;even by the very progress of civilization&mdash;from
a lower condition, as we find illustrated to-day in the
case of uncivilized races. That is easily proved by a
comparison of their languages, which is closely connected
with the comparison of their ideas. The higher
the conceptual faculty advances in thoughtful civilized
man, the more qualified he is to detect common
features amid a multitude of details, and embody them
in general concepts, and so much the clearer and
deeper does his consciousness become.</p>

Illusions</p>

<p>When we turn from the genetic study of the soul
to the great question of its immortality, we come
to that highest point of superstition which is regarded
as the impregnable citadel of all mystical and dualistic
notions. For in this crucial question, more than
in any other problem, philosophic thought is complicated
by the selfish interest of the human personality,
who is determined to have a guarantee of his existence
beyond the grave at any price. This &ldquo;higher necessity
of feeling&rdquo; is so powerful that it sweeps aside all
the logical arguments of critical reason. Consciously
or unconsciously, most men are influenced in all their
general views, and, therefore, in their theory of life, by
the dogma of personal immortality; and to this theoretical
error must be added practical consequences of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the most far-reaching character. It is our task, therefore,
to submit every aspect of this important dogma to
a critical examination, and to prove its untenability in
the light of the empirical data of modern biology.</p>

<p>In order to have a short and convenient expression
for the two opposed opinions on the question, we shall
call the belief in man&rsquo;s personal immortality &ldquo;athanatism&rdquo;
(from <i>athanes</i> or <i>athanatos</i> == immortal). On
the other hand, we give the name of &ldquo;thanatism&rdquo;
(from <i>thanatos</i> == death) to the opinion which holds
that at a man&rsquo;s death not only all the other physiological
functions are arrested, but his &ldquo;soul&rdquo; also disappears&mdash;that
is, that sum of cerebral functions which
psychic dualism regards as a peculiar entity, independent
of the other vital processes in the living body.</p>

<p>In approaching this physiological problem of death
we must point out the <i>individual</i> character of this organic
phenomenon. By death we understand simply
the definitive cessation of the vital activity of the <i>individual</i>
organism, no matter to which category or stage
of individuality the organism in question belongs.
Man is dead when his own personality ceases to exist,
whether he has left offspring that they may continue
to propagate for many generations or not. In a certain
sense we often say that the minds of great men
(in a dynasty of eminent rulers, for instance, or a family
of talented artists) live for many generations; and
in the same way we speak of the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; of a noble
woman living in her children and children&rsquo;s children.
But in these cases we are dealing with intricate phenomena
of <i>heredity</i>, in which a microscopic cell (the
sperm-cell of the father or the egg-cell of the mother)
transmits certain features to offspring. The particular
personalities who produce those sexual cells in thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>sands
are mortal beings, and at their death their personal
psychic activity is extinguished like every other
physiological function.</p>

<p>A number of eminent zoologists&mdash;Weismann being
particularly prominent&mdash;have recently defended the
opinion that only the lowest unicellular organisms,
the protists, are immortal, in contradistinction to the
multicellular plants and animals, whose bodies are
formed of tissues. This curious theory is especially
based on the fact that most of the protists multiply
without sexual means, by division or the formation of
spores. In such processes the whole body of the
unicellular organism breaks up into two or more
equal parts (daughter cells), and each of these portions
completes itself by further growth until it has the
size and form of the mother cell. However, by the
very process of division the <i>individuality</i> of the
unicellular creature has been destroyed; both its
physiological and its morphological unity have gone.
The view of Weismann is logically inconsistent with
the very notion of <i>individual</i>&mdash;an &ldquo;indivisible&rdquo; entity;
for it implies a unity which cannot be divided
without destroying its nature. In this sense the
unicellular protophyta and protozoa are throughout
life <i>physiological individuals</i>, just as much as the
multicellular tissue-plants and animals. A sexual
propagation by simple division is found in many of
the multicellular species (for instance, in many
cnidaria, corals, medusæ, etc.); the mother animal,
the division of which gives birth to the two daughter
animals, ceases to exist with the segmentation.
&ldquo;The protozoa,&rdquo; says Weismann, &ldquo;have no individuals
and no generations in the metazoic sense.&rdquo;
I must entirely dissent from his thesis. As I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the first to introduce the title of <i>metazoa</i>, and oppose
these multicellular, tissue-forming animals to the unicellular
<i>protozoa</i> (infusoria, rhizopods, etc.), and as
I was the first to point out the essential difference in
the development of the two (the former from germinal
layers, and the latter not), I must protest that I consider
the <i>protozoa</i> to be just as mortal in the physiological
(and psychological) sense as the <i>metazoa</i>; neither
body nor soul is immortal in either group. The
other erroneous consequences of Weismann&rsquo;s notion
have been refuted by Moebius (1884), who justly remarks
that &ldquo;every event in the world is periodic,&rdquo; and
that &ldquo;there is no source from which immortal organic
individuals might have sprung.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we take the idea of immortality in the widest
sense, and extend it to the totality of the knowable universe,
it has a scientific significance; it is then not
merely acceptable, but self-evident, to the monistic
philosopher. In that sense the thesis of the indestructibility
and eternal duration of all that exists is equivalent
to our supreme law of nature, the <i>law of substance</i>
(see <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">chap. xii</a>). As we intend to discuss this immortality
of the cosmos fully later on, in establishing the
theory of the persistence of matter and force, we shall
not dilate on it at present. We pass on immediately
to the criticism of that belief in immortality which is
the only sense usually attached to the word, the immortality
of the individual soul. We shall first inquire
into the extent and the origin of this mystic and
dualistic notion, and point out, in particular, the wide
acceptance of the contradictory thesis, our monistic,
empirically established <i>thanatism</i>. I must distinguish
two essentially different forms of thanatism&mdash;primary
and secondary; primary thanatism is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
original absence of the dogma of immortality (in the
primitive uncivilized races); secondary thanatism is
the later outcome of a rational knowledge of nature
in the civilized intelligence.</p>

<p>We still find it asserted in philosophic, and especially
in theological, works that belief in the personal
immortality of the human soul was originally shared
by all men&mdash;or, at least, by all &ldquo;rational&rdquo; men. That
is not the case. This dogma is not an original idea of
the human mind, nor has it ever found universal acceptance.
It has been absolutely proved by modern
comparative ethnology that many uncivilized races of
the earliest and most primitive stage had no notion
either of immortality or of God. That is true, for instance,
of the Veddahs of Ceylon, those primitive pygmies
whom, on the authority of the able studies of the
Sarasins, we consider to be a relic of the earliest inhabitants
of India;<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> it is also the case in several of the
earliest groups of the nearly related Dravidas, the Indian
Seelongs, and some native Australian races. Similarly,
several of the primitive branches of the American
race, in the interior of Brazil, on the upper
Amazon, etc., have no knowledge either of gods or
immortality. This <i>primary</i> absence of belief in immortality
and deity is an extremely important fact; it
is, obviously, easy to distinguish from the <i>secondary</i>
absence of such belief, which has come about in the
highest civilized races as the result of laborious critico-philosophical
study.</p>

<p>Differently from the primary thanatism which originally
characterized primitive man, and has always
been widely spread, the <i>secondary</i> absence of belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
in immortality is only found at a late stage of history:
it is the ripe fruit of profound reflection on life and death,
the outcome of bold and independent philosophical
speculation. We first meet it in some of the Ionic philosophers
of the sixth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>, then in the founders
of the old materialistic philosophy, Democritus and
Empedocles, and also in Simonides and Epicurus, Seneca
and Plinius, and in an elaborate form in Lucretius
Carus. With the spread of Christianity at the decay
of classical antiquity, athanatism, one of its chief articles
of faith, dominated the world, and so, amid other
forms of superstition, the myth of personal immortality
came to be invested with a high importance.</p>

<p>Naturally, through the long night of the Dark Ages
it was rarely that a brave free-thinker ventured to express
an opinion to the contrary: the examples of Galileo,
Giordano Bruno, and other independent philosophers,
effectually destroyed all freedom of utterance.
Heresy only became possible when the Reformation
and the Renaissance had broken the power of the papacy.
The history of modern philosophy tells of the
manifold methods by which the matured mind of man
sought to rid itself of the superstition of immortality.
Still, the intimate connection of the belief with the Christian
dogma invested it with such power, even in the
more emancipated sphere of Protestantism, that the
majority of convinced free-thinkers kept their sentiments
to themselves. From time to time some distinguished
scholar ventured to make a frank declaration
of his belief in the impossibility of the continued
life of the soul after death. This was done in France
in the second half of the eighteenth century by Voltaire,
Danton, Mirabeau, and others, and by the leaders
of the materialistic school of those days, Holbach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Lamettrie, etc. The same opinion was defended by the
able friend of the Materialists, the greatest of the Hohenzollerns,
the monistic &ldquo;philosopher of Sans-souci.&rdquo;
What would Frederick the Great, the &ldquo;crowned thanatist
and atheist,&rdquo; say, could he compare his monistic
views with those of his successor of to-day?</p>

<p>Among thoughtful physicians the conviction that the
existence of the soul came to an end at death has been
common for centuries: generally, however, they refrained
from giving it expression. Moreover, the empirical
science of the brain remained so imperfect during
the last century that the soul could continue to be
regarded as its mysterious inhabitant. It was the
gigantic progress of biology in the present century,
and especially in the latter half of the century, that
finally destroyed the myth. The establishment of
the theory of descent and the cellular theory, the
astounding discoveries of ontogeny and experimental
physiology&mdash;above all, the marvellous progress of the
microscopic anatomy of the brain, gradually deprived
athanatism of every basis; now, indeed, it is rarely
that an informed and honorable biologist is found to
defend the immortality of the soul. All the monistic
philosophers of the century (Strauss, Feuerbach, Büchner,
Spencer, etc.) are thanatists.</p>

<p>The dogma of personal immortality owes its great
popularity and its high importance to its intimate connection
with the teaching of Christianity. This circumstance
gave rise to the erroneous and still prevalent
belief that the myth is a fundamental element
of all the higher religions. That is by no means
the case. The higher Oriental religions include no
belief whatever in the immortality of the soul; it is
not found in Buddhism, the religion that dominates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
thirty per cent. of the entire human race; it is not
found in the ancient popular religion of the Chinese,
nor in the reformed religion of Confucius which succeeded
it; and, what is still more significant, it is
not found in the earlier and purer religion of the
Jews. Neither in the &ldquo;five Mosaic books,&rdquo; nor in
any of the writings of the Old Testament which were
written before the Babylonian Exile, is there any
trace of the notion of individual persistence after
death.</p>

<p>The mystic notion that the human soul will live forever
after death has had a polyphyletic origin. It was
unknown to the earliest speaking man (the hypothetical
<i>homo primigenius</i> of Asia), to his predecessors, of
course, the <i>pithecanthropus</i> and <i>prothylobates</i>, and to
the least developed of his modern successors, the Veddahs
of Ceylon, the Seelongs of India, and other distant
races. With the development of reason and deeper
reflection on life and death, sleep and dreams, mystic
ideas of a dualistic composition of our nature were
evolved&mdash;independently of each other&mdash;in a number of
the earlier races. Very different influences were at
work in these polyphyletic creations&mdash;worship of ancestors,
love of relatives, love of life and desire of its prolongation,
hope of better conditions of life beyond the
grave, hope of the reward of good and punishment
of evil deeds, and so forth. Comparative psychology
has recently brought to our knowledge a great variety
of myths and legends of that character; they are, for
the most part, closely associated with the oldest forms
of theistic and religious belief. In most of the modern
religions athanatism is intimately connected with theism;
the majority of believers transfer their materialistic
idea of a &ldquo;personal God&rdquo; to their <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>&ldquo;immortal soul.&rdquo;
That is particularly true of the dominant religion of
modern civilized states, Christianity.</p>

<p>As everybody knows, the dogma of the immortality
of the soul has long since assumed in the Christian
religion that rigid form which it has in the articles of
faith: &ldquo;I believe in the resurrection of the body and
in an eternal life.&rdquo; Man will arise on &ldquo;the last day,&rdquo;
as Christ is alleged to have done on Easter morn, and
receive a reward according to the tenor of his earthly
life. This typically Christian idea is thoroughly materialistic
and anthropomorphic; it is very little superior
to the corresponding crude legends of uncivilized
peoples. The impossibility of &ldquo;the resurrection of the
body&rdquo; is clear to every man who has some knowledge
of anatomy and physiology. The resurrection of Christ,
which is celebrated every Easter by millions of Christians,
is as purely mythical as &ldquo;the awakening of the
dead,&rdquo; which he is alleged to have taught. These mystic
articles of faith are just as untenable in the light of
pure reason as the cognate hypothesis of &ldquo;eternal life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fantastic notions which the Christian Church
disseminates as to the eternal life of the immortal soul
after the dissolution of the body are just as materialistic
as the dogma of &ldquo;the resurrection of the body.&rdquo;
In his interesting work on <i>Religion in the Light of the
Darwinian Theory</i>, Savage justly remarks: &ldquo;It is one
of the standing charges of the Church against science
that it is materialistic. I must say, in passing, that
the whole ecclesiastical doctrine of a future life has always
been, and still is, materialism of the purest type.
It teaches that the material body shall rise, and dwell
in a material heaven.&rdquo; To prove this one has only to
read impartially some of the sermons and ornate discourses
in which the glory of the future life is extolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
as the highest good of the Christian, and belief in it is
laid down to be the foundation of morality. According
to them, all the joys of the most advanced modern civilization
await the pious believer in Paradise, while
the &ldquo;All-loving Father&rdquo; reserves his eternal fires for
the godless materialist.</p>

<p>In opposition to the materialist athanatism, which is
dominant in the Christian and Mohammedan Churches,
we have, apparently, a purer and higher form of faith
in the <i>metaphysical athanatism</i>, as taught by most of
our dualist and spiritualist philosophers. Plato must
be considered its chief creator: in the fourth century
before Christ he taught that complete dualism of body
and soul which afterwards became one of the most important,
theoretically, and one of the most influential,
practically, of the Christian articles of faith. The body
is mortal, material, physical; the soul is immortal,
immaterial, metaphysical. They are only temporarily
associated, for the course of the individual life. As
Plato postulated an eternal life before as well as after
this temporary association, he must be classed as an
adherent of &ldquo;metempsychosis,&rdquo; or transmigration of
souls; the soul existed as such, or as an &ldquo;eternal idea,&rdquo;
before it entered into a human body. When it quits
one body it seeks such other as is most suited to its
character for its habitation. The souls of bloody tyrants
pass into the bodies of wolves and vultures, those
of virtuous toilers migrate into the bodies of bees and
ants, and so forth. The childish naïvety of this Platonic
morality is obvious; on closer examination his
views are found to be absolutely incompatible with the
scientific truth which we owe to modern anatomy,
physiology, histology, and ontogeny; we mention
them only because, in spite of their absurdity, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
have had a profound influence on thought and culture.
On the one hand, the mysticism of the Neo-Platonists,
which penetrated into Christianity, attaches itself to
the psychology of Plato; on the other hand, it became
subsequently one of the chief supports of spiritualistic
and idealistic philosophy. The Platonic &ldquo;idea&rdquo; gave
way in time to the notion of psychic &ldquo;substance&rdquo;; this
is just as incomprehensible and metaphysical, though
it often assumed a physical appearance.</p>

<p>The conception of the soul as a &ldquo;substance&rdquo; is far
from clear in many psychologists; sometimes it is regarded
as an &ldquo;immaterial&rdquo; entity of a peculiar character
in an abstract and idealistic sense, sometimes in a
concrete and realistic sense, and sometimes as a confused
<i>tertium quid</i> between the two. If we adhere to
the monistic idea of substance, which we develop in
<a href="#CHAPTER_XII">chap. xii</a>., and which takes it to be the simplest element
of our whole world-system, we find <i>energy</i> and <i>matter</i>
inseparably associated in it. We must, therefore, distinguish
in the &ldquo;substance of the soul&rdquo; the characteristic
psychic <i>energy</i> which is all we perceive (sensation,
presentation, volition, etc.), and the psychic <i>matter</i>,
which is the inseparable basis of its activity&mdash;that is,
the living protoplasm. Thus, in the higher animals
the &ldquo;matter&rdquo; of the soul is a part of the nervous system;
in the lower nerveless animals and plants it is a
part of their multicellular protoplasmic body; and in
the unicellular protists it is a part of their protoplasmic
cell-body. In this way we are brought once more to
the psychic organs, and to an appreciation of the fact
that these material organs are indispensable for the
action of the soul; but the soul itself is <i>actual</i>&mdash;it is
the sum-total of their physiological functions.</p>

<p>However, the idea of a specific <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>&ldquo;soul-substance&rdquo;
found in the dualistic philosophers who admit such
a thing is very different from this. They conceive
the immortal soul to be material, yet invisible, and
essentially different from the visible body which it
inhabits.</p>

<p>Thus <i>invisibility</i> comes to be regarded as a most important
attribute of the soul. Some, in fact, compare
the soul with ether, and regard it, like ether, as an extremely
subtle, light, and highly elastic material, an
imponderable agency, that fills the intervals between
the ponderable particles of the living organism, others
compare the soul with the wind, and so give it a gaseous
nature; and it is this simile which first found
favor with primitive peoples, and led in time to the familiar
dualistic conception. When a man died, the
body remained as a lifeless corpse, but the immortal
soul &ldquo;flew out of it with the last breath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The comparison of the human soul with physical
ether as a qualitatively similar idea has assumed a
more concrete shape in recent times through the great
progress of optics and electricity (especially in the last
decade); for these sciences have taught us a good deal
about the energy of ether, and enabled us to formulate
certain conclusions as to the material character of this
all-pervading agency. As I intend to describe these
important discoveries later on (in <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">chap. xii</a>.), I shall do
no more at present than briefly point out that they render
the notion of an &ldquo;etheric soul&rdquo; absolutely untenable.
Such an etheric soul&mdash;that is a psychic substance&mdash;which
is similar to physical ether, and which,
like ether, passes between the ponderable elements of
the living protoplasm or the molecules of the brain,
cannot possibly account for the individual life of the
soul. Neither the mystic notions of that kind which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
were warmly discussed about the middle of the century,
nor the attempts of modern &ldquo;Neovitalists&rdquo; to put their
mystical &ldquo;vital force&rdquo; on a line with physical ether,
call for refutation any longer.</p>

<p>Much more widespread, and still much respected, is
the view which ascribes a gaseous nature to the substance
of the soul. The comparison of human breath
with the wind is a very old one; they were originally
considered to be identical, and were both given the
same name. The <i>anemos</i> and <i>psyche</i> of the Greeks,
and the <i>anima</i> and <i>spiritus</i> of the Romans, were originally
all names for &ldquo;a breath of wind&rdquo;; they were transferred
from this to the breath of man. After a time
this &ldquo;living breath&rdquo; was identified with the &ldquo;vital
force,&rdquo; and finally it came to be regarded as the soul
itself, or, in a narrower sense, as its highest manifestation,
the &ldquo;spirit.&rdquo; From that the imagination went
on to derive the mystic notion of individual &ldquo;spirits&rdquo;;
these, also, are still usually conceived as &ldquo;aëriform
beings&rdquo;&mdash;though they are credited with the physiological
functions of an organism, and they have been
photographed in certain well-known spiritist circles.</p>

<p>Experimental physics has succeeded, during the
last decade of the century, in reducing all gaseous
bodies to a liquid&mdash;most of them, also, to a solid&mdash;condition.
Nothing more is needed than special apparatus,
which exerts a violent pressure on the gases at a
very low temperature. By this process not only the
atmospheric elements, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen,
but even compound gases (such as carbonic-acid
gas) and gaseous aggregates (like the atmosphere)
have been changed from gaseous to liquid form. In
this way the &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; substances have become &ldquo;visible&rdquo;
to all, and in a certain sense &ldquo;tangible.&rdquo; With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
this transformation the mystic nimbus which formerly
veiled the character of the gas in popular estimation&mdash;as
an invisible body that wrought visible effects&mdash;has
entirely disappeared. If, then, the substance of the
soul were really gaseous, it should be possible to liquefy
it by the application of a high pressure at a low temperature.
We could then catch the soul as it is &ldquo;breathed
out&rdquo; at the moment of death, condense it, and exhibit
it in a bottle as &ldquo;immortal fluid&rdquo; (<i>Fluidum animae
immortale</i>). By a further lowering of temperature
and increase of pressure it might be possible to solidify
it&mdash;to produce &ldquo;soul-snow.&rdquo; The experiment has not
yet succeeded.</p>

<p>If athanatism were true, if, indeed, the human soul
were to live for all eternity, we should have to grant
the same privilege to the souls of the higher animals,
at least to those of the nearest related mammals (apes,
dogs, etc.). For man is not distinguished from them
by a special <i>kind</i> of soul, or by any peculiar and exclusive
psychic function, but only by a higher <i>degree</i>
of psychic activity, a superior stage of development.
In particular, consciousness&mdash;the function of
the association of ideas, thought, and reason&mdash;has
reached a higher level in many men (by no means in
all) than in most of the animals. Yet this difference
is far from being so great as is popularly supposed;
and it is much slighter in every respect than the corresponding
difference between the higher and the lower
animal souls, or even the difference between the
highest and the lowest stages of the human soul itself.
If we ascribe &ldquo;personal immortality&rdquo; to man, we are
bound to grant it also to the higher animals.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, quite natural that we should find
this belief in the immortality of the animal soul among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
many ancient and modern peoples; we even meet it
sometimes to-day in many thoughtful men who postulate
an &ldquo;immortal life&rdquo; for themselves, and have,
at the same time, a thorough empirical knowledge of
the psychic life of the animals. I once knew an old
head-forester, who, being left a widower and without
children at an early age, had lived alone for more than
thirty years in a noble forest of East Prussia. His
only companions were one or two servants, with whom
he exchanged merely a few necessary words, and a
great pack of different kinds of dogs, with which he
lived in perfect psychic communion. Through many
years of training this keen observer and friend of nature
had penetrated deep into the individual souls of
his dogs, and he was as convinced of their personal
immortality as he was of his own. Some of his most
intelligent dogs were, in his impartial and objective
estimation, at a higher stage of psychic development
than his old, stupid maid and the rough, wrinkled manservant.
Any unprejudiced observer, who will study
the conscious and intelligent psychic activity of a fine
dog for a year, and follow attentively the physiological
processes of its thought, judgment, and reason, will
have to admit that it has just as valid a claim to immortality
as man himself.</p>

<p>The proofs of the immortality of the soul, which have
been adduced for the last two thousand years, and are,
indeed, still credited with some validity, have their origin,
for the most part, not in an effort to discover the
truth, but in an alleged &ldquo;necessity of emotion&rdquo;&mdash;that
is, in imagination and poetic conceit. As Kant puts
it, the immortality of the soul is not an object of pure
reason, but a &ldquo;postulate of practical reason.&rdquo; But we
must set &ldquo;practical reason&rdquo; entirely aside, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
with all the &ldquo;exigencies of emotion, or of moral education,
etc.,&rdquo; when we enter upon an honest and impartial
pursuit of truth; for we shall only attain it by the
work of pure reason, starting from empirical data and
capable of logical analysis. We have to say the same
of athanatism as of theism; both are creations of
poetic mysticism and of transcendental &ldquo;faith,&rdquo; not of
rational science.</p>

<p>When we come to analyze all the different proofs that
have been urged for the immortality of the soul, we find
that not a single one of them is of a scientific character;
not a single one is consistent with the truths we have
learned in the last few decades from physiological psychology
and the theory of descent. The <i>theological</i>
proof&mdash;that a personal creator has breathed an immortal
soul (generally regarded as a portion of the divine
soul) into man&mdash;is a pure myth. The <i>cosmological</i>
proof&mdash;that the &ldquo;moral order of the world&rdquo; demands
the eternal duration of the human soul&mdash;is a baseless
dogma. The <i>teleological</i> proof&mdash;that the &ldquo;higher destiny&rdquo;
of man involves the perfecting of his defective,
earthly soul beyond the grave&mdash;rests on a false anthropism.
The <i>moral</i> proof&mdash;that the defects and the
unsatisfied desires of earthly existence must be fulfilled
by &ldquo;compensative justice&rdquo; on the other side of eternity&mdash;is
nothing more than a pious wish. The <i>ethnological</i>
proof&mdash;that the belief in immortality, like the belief in
God, is an innate truth, common to all humanity&mdash;is
an error in fact. The <i>ontological</i> proof&mdash;that the soul,
being a &ldquo;simple, immaterial, and indivisible entity,&rdquo;
cannot be involved in the corruption of death&mdash;is based
on an entirely erroneous view of the psychic phenomena;
it is a spiritualistic fallacy. All these and similar
&ldquo;proofs of athanatism&rdquo; are in a parlous condition;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
they are definitely annulled by the scientific criticism
of the last few decades.</p>

<p>The extreme importance of the subject leads us to
oppose to these untenable &ldquo;proofs of immortality&rdquo; a
brief exposition of the sound scientific arguments
against it. The <i>physiological</i> argument shows that
the human soul is not an independent, immaterial
substance, but, like the soul of all the higher animals,
merely a collective title for the sum-total of man&rsquo;s cerebral
functions; and these are just as much determined
by physical and chemical processes as any of the other
vital functions, and just as amenable to the law of substance.
The <i>histological</i> argument is based on the extremely
complicated microscopic structure of the brain;
it shows us the true &ldquo;elementary organs of the soul&rdquo;
in the ganglionic cells. The <i>experimental</i> argument
proves that the various functions of the soul are bound
up with certain special parts of the brain, and cannot
be exercised unless these are in a normal condition;
if the areas are destroyed, their function is extinguished;
and this is especially applicable to the &ldquo;organs
of thought,&rdquo; the four central instruments of mental
activity. The <i>pathological</i> argument is the complement
of the physiological; when certain parts of the
brain (the centres of speech, sight, hearing, etc.) are
destroyed by sickness, their activity (speech, vision,
hearing, etc.) disappears; in this way nature herself
makes the decisive physiological experiment. The
<i>ontogenetic</i> argument puts before us the facts of the
development of the soul in the individual; we see how
the child-soul gradually unfolds its various powers;
the youth presents them in full bloom, the mature man
shows their ripe fruit; in old age we see the gradual
decay of the psychic powers, corresponding to the senile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
degeneration of the brain. The <i>phylogenetic</i> argument
derives its strength from palæontology, and the comparative
anatomy and physiology of the brain; co-operating
with and completing each other, these sciences
prove to the hilt that the human brain (and, consequently,
its function&mdash;the soul) has been evolved step
by step from that of the mammal, and, still further
back, from that of the lower vertebrate.</p>

<p>These inquiries, which might be supplemented by
many other results of modern science, prove the old
dogma of the immortality of the soul to be absolutely
untenable; in the twentieth century it will not be regarded
as a subject of serious scientific research, but
will be left wholly to transcendental &ldquo;faith.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;critique of pure reason&rdquo; shows this treasured faith
to be a mere <i>superstition</i>, like the belief in a personal
God which generally accompanies it. Yet even to-day
millions of &ldquo;believers&rdquo;&mdash;not only of the lower,
uneducated masses, but even of the most cultured
classes&mdash;look on this superstition as their dearest possession
and their most &ldquo;priceless treasure.&rdquo; It is,
therefore, necessary to enter more deeply into the subject,
and&mdash;assuming it to be true&mdash;to make a critical
inquiry into its practical value. It soon becomes apparent
to the impartial critic that this value rests, for
the most part, on fancy, on the want of clear judgment
and consecutive thought. It is my firm and honest
conviction that a definitive abandonment of these
&ldquo;athanatist illusions&rdquo; would involve no painful loss,
but an inestimable positive gain for humanity.</p>

<p>Man&rsquo;s &ldquo;emotional craving&rdquo; clings to the belief on
immortality for two main reasons: firstly, in the hope
of better conditions of life beyond the grave; and, secondly,
in the hope of seeing once more the dear and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
loved ones whom death has torn from us. As for the
first hope, it corresponds to a natural feeling of the
justice of compensation, which is quite correct subjectively,
but has no objective validity whatever. We
make our claim for an indemnity for the unnumbered
defects and sorrows of our earthly existence, without
the slightest real prospect or guarantee of receiving it.
We long for an eternal life in which we shall meet no
sadness and no pain, but an unbounded peace and joy.
The pictures that most men form of this blissful existence
are extremely curious; the immaterial soul is
placed in the midst of grossly material pleasures. The
imagination of each believer paints the enduring splendor
according to his personal taste. The American Indian,
whose athanatism Schiller has so well depicted,
trusts to find in his Paradise the finest hunting-grounds
with innumerable hordes of buffaloes and bears; the
Eskimo looks forward to sun-tipped icebergs with an
inexhaustible supply of bears, seals, and other polar
animals; the effeminate Cingalese frames his Paradise
on the wonderful island-paradise of Ceylon with
its noble gardens and forests&mdash;adding that there will
be unlimited supplies of rice and curry, of cocoanuts
and other fruit, always at hand; the Mohammedan
Arab believes it will be a place of shady gardens of
flowers, watered by cool springs, and filled with lovely
maidens; the Catholic fisherman of Sicily looks forward
to a daily superabundance of the most valuable
fishes and the finest macaroni, and eternal absolution
for all his sins, which he can go on committing in his
eternal home; the evangelical of North Europe longs
for an immense Gothic cathedral, in which he can chant
the praises of the Lord of Hosts for all eternity. In a
word, each believer really expects his eternal life to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
a direct continuation of his individual life on earth,
only in a &ldquo;much improved and enlarged edition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We must lay special stress on the thoroughly materialistic
character of <i>Christian</i> athanatism, which is
closely connected with the absurd dogma of the &ldquo;resurrection
of the body.&rdquo; As thousands of paintings of
famous masters inform us, the bodies that have risen
again, with the souls that have been born again, walk
about in heaven just as they did in this vale of tears;
they see God with their eyes, they hear His voice with
their ears, they sing hymns to His praise with their
larynx, and so forth. In fine, the modern inhabitants
of the Christian Paradise have the same dual character
of body and soul, the same organs of an earthly body,
as our ancient ancestors had in Odin&rsquo;s Hall in Walhalla,
as the &ldquo;immortal&rdquo; Turks and Arabs have in
Mohammed&rsquo;s lovely gardens, as the old Greek demi-gods
and heroes had in the enjoyment of nectar and
ambrosia at the table of Zeus.</p>

<p>But, however gloriously we may depict this eternal
life in Paradise, it remains <i>endless</i> in duration. Do
we realize what &ldquo;eternity&rdquo; means?&mdash;the uninterrupted
continuance of our individual life forever! The profound
legend of the &ldquo;wandering Jew,&rdquo; the fruitless
search for rest of the unhappy Ahasuerus, should teach
us to appreciate such an &ldquo;eternal life&rdquo; at its true value.
The best we can desire after a courageous life, spent in
doing good according to our light, is the eternal peace
of the grave. &ldquo;Lord, give them an eternal rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Any impartial scholar who is acquainted with geological
calculations of time, and has reflected on the
long series of millions of years the organic history of
the earth has occupied, must admit that the crude notion
of an eternal life is not a <i>comfort</i>, but a fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
<i>menace</i>, to the best of men. Only want of clear judgment
and consecutive thought can dispute it.</p>

<p>The best and most plausible ground for athanatism
is found in the hope that immortality will reunite us
to the beloved friends who have been prematurely taken
from us by some grim mischance. But even this supposed
good fortune proves to be an illusion on closer
inquiry; and in any case it would be greatly marred
by the prospect of meeting the less agreeable acquaintances
and the enemies who have troubled our existence
here below. Even the closest family ties would involve
many a difficulty. There are plenty of men who
would gladly sacrifice all the glories of Paradise if it
meant the eternal companionship of their &ldquo;better half&rdquo;
and their mother-in-law. It is more than questionable
whether Henry VIII. would like the prospect of living
eternally with his six wives; or Augustus the Strong
of Poland, who had a hundred mistresses and three
hundred and fifty-two children. As he was on good
terms with the Vicar of Christ, he must be assumed to
be in Paradise, in spite of his sins, and in spite of the
fact that his mad military ventures cost the lives of
more than a hundred thousand Saxons.</p>

<p>Another insoluble difficulty faces the athanatist
when he asks <i>in what stage of their individual development</i>
the disembodied souls will spend their eternal
life. Will the new-born infant develop its psychic
powers in heaven under the same hard conditions of
the &ldquo;struggle for life&rdquo; which educate man here on
earth? Will the talented youth who has fallen in the
wholesale murder of war unfold his rich, unused mental
powers in Walhalla? Will the feeble, childish old
man, who has filled the world with the fame of his
deeds in the ripeness of his age, live forever in mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
decay? Or will he return to an earlier stage of development?
If the immortal souls in Olympus are to live
in a condition of rejuvenescence and perfectness, then
both the stimulus to the formation of, and the interest
in, personality disappear for them.</p>

<p>Not less impossible, in the light of pure reason, do
we find the anthropistic myth of the &ldquo;last judgment,&rdquo;
and the separation of the souls of men into two great
groups, of which one is destined for the eternal joys of
Paradise and the other for the eternal torments of hell&mdash;and
that from a personal God who is called the
&ldquo;Father of Love&rdquo;! And it is this &ldquo;Universal Father&rdquo;
who has himself created the conditions of heredity and
adaptation, in virtue of which the elect, on the one
side, were <i>bound</i> to pursue the path towards eternal
bliss, and the luckless poor and miserable, on the other
hand, were <i>driven</i> into the paths of the damned?</p>

<p>A critical comparison of the countless and manifold
fantasies which belief in immortality has produced
during the last few thousand years in the different
races and religions yields a most remarkable picture.
An intensely interesting presentation of it, based on
most extensive original research, may be found in
Adalbert Svoboda&rsquo;s distinguished works, <i>The Illusion
of the Soul</i> and <i>Forms of Faith</i>. However absurd and
inconsistent with modern knowledge most of these
myths seem to be, they still play an important part,
and, as &ldquo;postulates of practical reason,&rdquo; they exercise
a powerful influence on the opinions of individuals and
on the destiny of races.</p>

<p>The idealist and spiritualist philosophy of the day
will freely grant that these prevalent materialistic
forms of belief in immortality are untenable; it will
say that the refined idea of an immaterial soul, a Pla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>tonic
&ldquo;idea&rdquo; or a transcendental psychic substance,
must be substituted for them. But modern realism
can have nothing whatever to do with these incomprehensible
notions; they satisfy neither the mind&rsquo;s feeling
of causality nor the yearning of our emotions. If
we take a comprehensive glance at all that modern
anthropology, psychology, and cosmology teach with
regard to athanatism, we are forced to this definite conclusion:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>&ldquo;The belief in the immortality of the human
soul is a dogma which is in hopeless contradiction with
the most solid empirical truths of modern science.&rdquo;</p>

and Ponderable Matter&mdash;Force and Energy&mdash;Potential and

Law of Substance</p>

<p>The supreme and all-pervading law of nature, the
true and only cosmological law, is, in my opinion,
<i>the law of substance</i>; its discovery and establishment
is the greatest intellectual triumph of the nineteenth
century, in the sense that all other known laws
of nature are subordinate to it. Under the name of
&ldquo;law of substance&rdquo; we embrace two supreme laws of
different origin and age&mdash;the older is the chemical law
of the &ldquo;conservation of matter,&rdquo; and the younger is
the physical law of the &ldquo;conservation of energy.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It
will be self-evident to many readers, and it is acknowledged
by most of the scientific men of the day, that
these two great laws are essentially inseparable. This
fundamental thesis, however, is still much contested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
in some quarters, and we must proceed to furnish the
proof of it. But we must first devote a few words to
each of the two laws.</p>

<p>The law of the &ldquo;<i>persistence</i>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>indestructibility of
matter</i>,&rdquo; established by Lavoisier in 1789, may be formulated
thus: The sum of matter, which fills infinite
space, is unchangeable. A body has merely changed
its form, when it seems to have disappeared. When
coal burns, it is changed into carbonic-acid gas by combination
with the oxygen of the atmosphere; when a
piece of sugar melts in water, it merely passes from
the solid to the fluid condition. In the same way, it is
merely a question of change of form in the cases where
a new body seems to be produced. A shower of rain
is the moisture of the atmosphere cast down in the form
of drops of water; when a piece of iron rusts, the surface
layer of the metal has combined with water and
with atmospheric oxygen, and formed a &ldquo;rust,&rdquo; or oxyhydrate
of iron. Nowhere in nature do we find an
example of the production, or &ldquo;creation,&rdquo; of new
matter; nowhere does a particle of existing matter
pass entirely away. This empirical truth is now the
unquestionable foundation of chemistry; it may be
directly verified at any moment by means of the balance.
To the great French chemist Lavoisier belongs
the high merit of first making this experiment with the
balance. At the present day the scientist, who is occupied
from one end of the year to the other with the
study of natural phenomena, is so firmly convinced of
the absolute &ldquo;constancy&rdquo; of matter that he is no longer
able to imagine the contrary state of things.</p>

<p>We may formulate the &ldquo;<i>law of the persistence of force</i>&rdquo;
or &ldquo;<i>conservation of energy</i>&rdquo; thus: The sum of force,
which is at work in infinite space and produces all phe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>nomena,
is unchangeable. When the locomotive rushes
along the line, the potential energy of the steam is transformed
into the kinetic or actual energy of the mechanical
movement; when we hear its shrill whistle, as it
speeds along, the sound-waves of the vibrating atmosphere
are conveyed through the tympanum and the
three bones of the ear into the inner labyrinth, and
thence transferred by the auditory nerve to the acoustic
ganglionic cells which form the centre of hearing in
the temporal lobe of the gray bed of the brain. The
whole marvellous panorama of life that spreads over
the surface of our globe is, in the last analysis, transformed
sunlight. It is well known how the remarkable
progress of technical science has made it possible
for us to convert the different physical forces from one
form to another; heat may be changed into molar
movement, or movement of mass; this in turn into
light or sound, and then into electricity, and so forth.
Accurate measurement of the quantity of force which
is used in this metamorphosis has shown that it is &ldquo;constant&rdquo;
or unchanged. No particle of living energy is
ever extinguished; no particle is ever created anew.
Friedrich Mohr, of Bonn, was very near to the discovery
of this great fact in 1837, but the discovery was
actually made by the able Swabian physician, Robert
Mayer, of Heilbronn, in 1842. Independently of Mayer,
however, the principle was reached almost at the same
time by the famous physiologist, Hermann Helmholtz;
five years afterwards he pointed out its general application
to, and fertility in, every branch of physics. We
ought to say to-day that it rules also in the entire province
of physiology&mdash;that is, of &ldquo;organic physics&rdquo;;
but on that point we meet a strenuous opposition from
the vitalistic biologists and the dualist and spiritualist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
philosophers. For these the peculiar &ldquo;spiritual forces&rdquo;
of human nature are a group of &ldquo;free&rdquo; forces, not subject
to the law of energy; the idea is closely connected
with the dogma of the &ldquo;freedom of the will.&rdquo; We have,
however, already seen (<a href="#Page_204">p. 204</a>) that the dogma is untenable.
Modern physics draws a distinction between
&ldquo;force&rdquo; and &ldquo;energy,&rdquo; but our general observations
so far have not needed a reference to it.</p>

<p>The conviction that these two great cosmic theorems,
the chemical law of the persistence of matter and the
physical law of the persistence of force, are fundamentally
one, is of the utmost importance in our monistic
system. The two theories are just as intimately united
as their objects&mdash;matter and force or energy. Indeed,
this fundamental unity of the two laws is self-evident
to many monistic scientists and philosophers, since they
merely relate to two different aspects of one and the
same object, the <i>cosmos</i>. But, however natural the
thought may be, it is still very far from being generally
accepted. It is stoutly contested by the entire dualistic
philosophy, vitalistic biology, and parallelistic
psychology; even, in fact, by a few (inconsistent) monists,
who think they find a check to it in &ldquo;consciousness,&rdquo;
in the higher mental activity of man, or in other
phenomena of our &ldquo;free mental life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For my part, I am convinced of the profound importance
of the unifying &ldquo;law of substance,&rdquo; as an
expression of the inseparable connection in reality
of two laws which are only separated in conception.
That they were not originally taken together and their
unity recognized from the beginning is merely an accident
of the date of their respective discoveries. The
earlier and more accessible chemical law of the persistence
of matter was detected by Lavoisier in 1789,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
and, after a general application of the balance, became
the basis of exact chemistry. On the other hand, the
more recondite law of the persistence of force was only
discovered by Mayer in 1842, and only laid down as the
basis of exact physics by Helmholtz. The unity of the
two laws&mdash;still much disputed&mdash;is expressed by many
scientists who are convinced of it in the formula: &ldquo;Law
of the persistence of matter and force.&rdquo; In order to have
a briefer and more convenient expression for this fundamental
thought, I proposed some time ago to call it
the &ldquo;law of substance&rdquo; or the &ldquo;fundamental cosmic
law&rdquo;; it might also be called the &ldquo;universal law,&rdquo; or
the &ldquo;law of constancy,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;axiom of the constancy
of the universe.&rdquo; In the ultimate analysis it is found
to be a necessary consequence of the principle of causality.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The first thinker to introduce the purely monistic conception
of substance into science and appreciate its
profound importance was the great philosopher Baruch
Spinoza; his chief work appeared shortly after
his premature death in 1677, just one hundred years
before Lavoisier gave empirical proof of the constancy
of matter by means of the chemist&rsquo;s principal instrument,
the balance. In his stately pantheistic system
the notion of the <i>world</i> (the universe, or the cosmos)
is identical with the all-pervading notion of God; it
is at one and the same time the purest and most rational
<i>monism</i> and the clearest and most abstract <i>monotheism</i>.
This universal substance, this &ldquo;divine nature of the
world,&rdquo; shows us two different aspects of its being, or
two fundamental attributes&mdash;matter (infinitely <i>extended</i>
substance) and spirit (the all-embracing energy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
<i>thought</i>). All the changes which have since come over
the idea of substance are reduced, on a logical analysis,
to this supreme thought of Spinoza&rsquo;s; with Goethe I
take it to be the loftiest, profoundest, and truest thought
of all ages. Every single object in the world which
comes within the sphere of our cognizance, all individual
forms of existence, are but special transitory forms&mdash;<i>accidents</i>
or <i>modes</i>&mdash;of substance. These modes
are material things when we regard them under the
attribute of <i>extension</i> (or &ldquo;occupation of space&rdquo;), but
forces or ideas when we consider them under the attribute
of <i>thought</i> (or &ldquo;energy&rdquo;). To this profound
thought of Spinoza our purified monism returns after
a lapse of two hundred years; for us, too, matter (space-filling
substance) and energy (moving force) are but
two inseparable attributes of the one underlying substance.</p>

<p>Among the various modifications which the fundamental
idea of substance has undergone in modern
physics, in association with the prevalent atomism,
we shall select only two of the most divergent theories
for a brief discussion, the kinetic and the pyknotic.
Both theories agree that we have succeeded in reducing
all the different forces of nature to one common original
force; gravity and chemical action, electricity and
magnetism, light and heat, etc., are only different manifestations,
forms, or <i>dynamodes</i>, of a single primitive
force (<i>prodynamis</i>). This fundamental force is generally
conceived as a vibratory motion of the smallest
particles of matter&mdash;a vibration of atoms. The atoms
themselves, according to the usual &ldquo;kinetic theory of
substance,&rdquo; are dead, separate particles of matter, which
dance to and fro in empty space and act at a distance.
The real founder and most distinguished representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
of the kinetic theory is Newton, the famous discoverer
of the law of gravitation. In his great work, the <i>Philosophiae
Naturalis Principia Mathematica</i> (1687), he
showed that throughout the universe the same law of
attraction controls the unvarying constancy of gravitation;
the attraction of two particles being in direct
proportion to their mass and in inverse proportion to
the square of their distance. This universal force of
gravity is at work in the fall of an apple and the tidal
wave no less than in the course of the planets round
the sun and the movements of all the heavenly bodies.
Newton had the immortal merit of establishing the law
of gravitation and embodying it in an indisputable
mathematical formula. Yet this <i>dead mathematical
formula</i>, on which most scientists lay great stress, as
so frequently happens, gives us merely the <i>quantitative</i>
demonstration of the theory; it gives us no insight
whatever into the <i>qualitative</i> nature of the phenomena.
The action at a distance without a medium, which Newton
deduced from his law of gravitation, and which became
one of the most serious and most dangerous dogmas
of later physics, does not afford the slightest explanation
of the real causes of attraction; indeed, it
long obstructed our way to the real discovery of them.
I cannot but suspect that his speculations on this mysterious
action at a distance contributed not a little to
the leading of the great English mathematician into
the obscure labyrinth of mystic dreams and theistic
superstition in which he passed the last thirty-four years
of his life; we find him, at the end, giving metaphysical
hypotheses on the predictions of Daniel and on the
paradoxical fantasies of St. John.</p>

<p>In fundamental opposition to the theory of vibration,
or the kinetic theory of substance, we have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
modern &ldquo;theory of condensation,&rdquo; or the pyknotic
theory of substance. It is most ably established in
the suggestive work of J. C. Vogt on <i>The Nature of
Electricity and Magnetism on the Basis of a Simplified
Conception of Substance</i> (1891). Vogt assumes the
primitive force of the world, the universal <i>prodynamis</i>,
to be, not the vibration or oscillation of particles in
empty space, but the condensation of a simple primitive
substance, which fills the infinity of space in an unbroken
continuity. Its sole inherent mechanical form
of activity consists in a tendency to condensation or
contraction, which produces infinitesimal centres of
condensation; these may change their degree of thickness,
and, therefore, their volume, but are constant as
such. These minute parts of the universal substance,
the centres of condensation, which might be called
<i>pyknatoms</i>, correspond in general to the ultimate separate
atoms of the kinetic theory; they differ, however,
very considerably in that they are credited with
sensation and inclination (or will-movement of the
simplest form), <i>with souls</i>, in a certain sense&mdash;in harmony
with the old theory of Empedocles of the &ldquo;love
and hatred of the elements.&rdquo; Moreover, these &ldquo;atoms
with souls&rdquo; do not float in empty space, but in
the continuous, extremely attenuated intermediate
substance, which represents the uncondensed portion
of the primitive matter. By means of certain &ldquo;constellations,
centres of perturbation, or systems of deformation,&rdquo;
great masses of centres of condensation
quickly unite in immense proportions, and so obtain a
preponderance over the surrounding masses. By that
process the primitive substance, which in its original
state of quiescence had the same mean consistency
throughout, divides or differentiates into two kinds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
The centres of disturbance, which <i>positively</i> exceed the
mean consistency in virtue of the <i>pyknosis</i> or condensation,
form the ponderable matter of bodies; the finer,
intermediate substance, which occupies the space between
them, and <i>negatively</i> falls below the mean consistency,
forms the ether, or imponderable matter. As
a consequence of this division into mass and ether there
ensues a ceaseless struggle between the two antagonistic
elements, and this struggle is the source of all
physical processes. The positive ponderable matter,
the element with the feeling of like or desire, is continually
striving to complete the process of condensation,
and thus collecting an enormous amount of <i>potential</i>
energy; the negative, imponderable matter, on the
other hand, offers a perpetual and equal resistance to
the further increase of its strain and of the feeling of
dislike connected therewith, and thus gathers the utmost
amount of <i>actual</i> energy.</p>

<p>We cannot go any further here into the details of the
brilliant theory of J. C. Vogt. The interested reader
cannot do better than have recourse to the second volume
of the above work for a clear, popular exposition
of the difficult problem. I am myself too little informed
in physics and mathematics to enter into a critical discussion
of its lights and shades; still, I think that this
pyknotic theory of substance will prove more acceptable
to every biologist who is convinced of the unity
of nature than the kinetic theory which prevails in
physics to-day. A misunderstanding may easily arise
from the fact that Vogt puts his process of condensation
in explicit contradiction with the general phenomenon
of motion; but it must be remembered that he is
speaking of vibratory movement in the sense of the
physicist. His hypothetical &ldquo;condensation&rdquo; is just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
much determined by a movement of substance as is the
hypothetical &ldquo;vibration&rdquo;; only the kind of movement
and the relation of the moving elements are very different
in the two hypotheses. Moreover, it is not the
whole theory of vibration, but only an important section
of it, that is contradicted by the theory of condensation.</p>

<p>Modern physics, for the most part, still firmly adheres
to the older theory of vibration, to the idea of an
<i>actio in distans</i> and the eternal vibration of dead atoms
in empty space; it rejects the pyknotic theory. Although
Vogt&rsquo;s theory may be still far from perfect,
and his original speculations may be marred by many
errors, yet I think he has rendered a very good service
in eliminating the untenable principles of the kinetic
theory of substance. As to my own opinion&mdash;and that
of many other scientists&mdash;I must lay down the following
theses, which are involved in Vogt&rsquo;s pyknotic theory,
as indispensable for a truly monistic view of substance,
and one that covers the whole field of organic and inorganic
nature:</p>

<p>I. The two fundamental forms of substance, ponderable
matter and ether, are not dead and only moved
by extrinsic force, but they are endowed with sensation
and will (though, naturally, of the lowest grade); they
experience an inclination for condensation, a dislike of
strain; they strive after the one and struggle against
the other.</p>

<p>II. There is no such thing as empty space; that
part of space which is not occupied with ponderable
atoms is filled with ether.</p>

<p>III. There is no such thing as an action at a distance
through perfectly empty space; all action of
bodies upon each other is either determined by immediate
contact or is effected by the mediation of ether.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>Both the theories of substance which we have just
contrasted are <i>monistic</i> in principle, since the opposition
between the two conditions of substance&mdash;mass
and ether&mdash;is not original; moreover, they involve a
continuous immediate contact and reciprocal action of
the two elements. It is otherwise with the <i>dualistic</i>
theories of substance which still obtain in the idealist
and spiritualist philosophy, and which have the support
of a powerful theology, in so far as theology indulges
in such metaphysical speculations. These
theories draw a distinction between two entirely different
kinds of substance, material and immaterial.
Material substance enters into the composition of the
bodies which are the object of physics and chemistry;
the law of the persistence of matter and force is confined
to this world (apart from a belief in its &ldquo;creation
from nothing&rdquo; and other miracles). Immaterial substance
is found in the &ldquo;spiritual world&rdquo; to which the
law does not extend; in this province the laws of
physics and chemistry are either entirely inapplicable
or they are subordinated to a &ldquo;vital force,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;free
will,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;divine omnipotence,&rdquo; or some other phantom
which is beyond the ken of critical science. In
truth, these profound errors need no further refutation
to-day, for experience has never yet discovered for us
a single immaterial substance, a single force which is
not dependent on matter, or a single form of energy
which is not exerted by material movement, whether it
be of mass, or of ether, or of both. Even the most elaborate
and most perfect forms of energy that we know&mdash;the
psychic life of the higher animals, the thought and reason
of man&mdash;depend on material processes, or changes in
the neuroplasm of the ganglionic cells; they are inconceivable
apart from such modifications. I have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
shown (<a href="#CHAPTER_XI">chap. xi</a>.) that the physiological hypothesis of a
special, immaterial &ldquo;soul-substance&rdquo; is untenable.</p>

<p>The study of ponderable matter is primarily the concern
of chemistry. Few are ignorant of the astonishing
theoretical progress which this science has made
in the course of the century and the immense practical
influence it has had on every aspect of modern life.
We shall confine ourselves here to a few remarks on
the more important questions which concern the nature
of ponderable matter. It is well known that analytical
chemistry has succeeded in resolving the immense
variety of bodies in nature into a small number
of simple elements&mdash;that is, simple bodies which are
incapable of further analysis. The number of these
elements is about seventy. Only fourteen of them are
widely distributed on the earth and of much practical
importance; the majority are rare elements (principally
metals) of little practical moment. The affinity
of these groups of elements, and the remarkable
proportions of their atomic weights, which
Lothar Meyer and Mendelejeff have proved in their
<i>Periodic System of the Elements</i>, make it extremely
probable that they are not <i>absolute species</i> of ponderable
matter&mdash;that is, not eternally unchangeable particles.
The seventy elements have in that system
been distributed into eight leading groups, and arranged
in them according to their atomic weight, so
that the elements which have a chemical affinity are
formed into families. The relations of the various
groups in such a natural system of the elements recall,
on the one hand, similar relations of the innumerable
compounds of carbon, and, again, the relations of parallel
groups in the natural arrangement of the animal
and plant species. Since in the latter cases the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>&ldquo;affinity&rdquo;
of the related forms is based on descent from a
common parent form, it seems very probable that the
same holds good of the families and orders of the chemical
elements. We may, therefore, conclude that the
&ldquo;empirical elements&rdquo; we now know are not really simple,
ultimate, and unchangeable forms of matter, but
compounds of homogeneous, simple, primitive atoms,
variously distributed as to number and grouping. The
recent speculations of Gustav Wendt, Wilhelm Preyer,
Sir W. Crookes, and others, have pointed out how we
may conceive the evolution of the elements from a simple
primitive material, the <i>prothyl</i>.</p>

<p>The modern atomistic theory, which is regarded as
an indispensable instrument in chemistry to-day, must
be carefully distinguished from the old philosophic
atomism which was taught more than two thousand
years ago by a group of distinguished thinkers of
antiquity&mdash;Leucippus, Democritus, and Epicurus: it
was considerably developed and modified later on by
Descartes, Hobbes, Leibnitz, and other famous philosophers.
But it was not until 1808 that modern atomism
assumed a definite and acceptable form, and was furnished
with an empirical basis by Dalton, who formulated
the &ldquo;law of simple and multiple proportions&rdquo;
in the formation of chemical combinations. He first
determined the atomic weight of the different elements,
and thus created the solid and exact foundation on
which more recent chemical theories are based; these
are all <i>atomistic</i>, in the sense that they assume the
elements to be made up of homogeneous, infinitesimal,
distinct particles, which are incapable of further analysis.
That does not touch the question of the real
nature of the atoms&mdash;their form, size, psychology, etc.
These atomic qualities are merely hypothetical; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the <i>chemistry</i> of the atoms, their &ldquo;chemical affinity&rdquo;&mdash;that
is, the constant proportion in which they combine
with the atoms of other elements&mdash;is empirical.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The different relation of the various elements towards
each other, which chemistry calls &ldquo;affinity,&rdquo; is one of
the most important properties of ponderable matter;
it is manifested in the different relative quantities or
proportions of their combination in the intensity of
its consummation. Every shade of inclination, from
complete indifference to the fiercest passion, is exemplified
in the chemical relation of the various elements
towards each other, just as we find in the psychology
of man, and especially in the life of the sexes. Goethe,
in his classical romance, <i>Affinities</i>, compared the relations
of pairs of lovers with the phenomenon of the
same name in the formation of chemical combinations.
The irresistible passion that draws Edward to the sympathetic
Ottilia, or Paris to Helen, and leaps over all
bounds of reason and morality, is the same powerful
&ldquo;unconscious&rdquo; attractive force which impels the living
spermatozoon to force an entrance into the ovum in
the fertilization of the egg of the animal or plant&mdash;the
same impetuous movement which unites two atoms of
hydrogen to one atom of oxygen for the formation of a
molecule of water. This fundamental <i>unity of affinity
in the whole of nature</i>, from the simplest chemical process
to the most complicated love story, was recognized by
the great Greek scientist, Empedocles, in the fifth century
<span class="small">B.C.</span>, in his theory of &ldquo;the love and hatred of the
elements.&rdquo; It receives empirical confirmation from
the interesting progress of cellular psychology, the
great significance of which we have only learned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
appreciate in the last thirty years. On those phenomena
we base our conviction that even the <i>atom</i> is not
without a rudimentary form of sensation and will, or
as it is better expressed, of feeling (<i>aesthesis</i>) and inclination
(<i>tropesis</i>)&mdash;that is, a universal &ldquo;soul&rdquo; of
the simplest character. The same must be said of the
molecules which are composed of two or more atoms.
Further combinations of different kinds of these molecules
give rise to simple and, subsequently, complex
chemical compounds, in the activity of which the same
phenomena are repeated in a more complicated form.</p>

<p>The study of ether, or imponderable matter, pertains
principally to physics. The existence of an extremely
attenuated medium, filling the whole of space
outside of ponderable matter, was known and applied
to the elucidation of various phenomena (especially
light) a long time ago; but it was not until the second
half of the nineteenth century that we became more
closely acquainted with this remarkable substance, in
connection with our astonishing empirical discoveries in
the province of electricity, with their experimental detection,
their theoretical interpretation, and their practical
application. The path was opened in particular
by the famous researches of Heinrich Hertz, of Bonn,
in 1888. The premature death of a brilliant young
physicist of so much promise cannot be sufficiently
deplored. Like the premature death of Spinoza, Raphael,
Schubert, and many other great men, it is one
of those brutal facts of human history which are enough
of themselves to destroy the untenable myth of a &ldquo;wise
Providence&rdquo; and an &ldquo;All-loving Father in heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The existence of ether (or cosmic ether) as a real element
is a <i>positive fact</i>, and has been known as such
for the last twelve years. We sometimes read even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
to-day that ether is a &ldquo;pure hypothesis&rdquo;; this erroneous
assertion comes not only from uninformed philosophers
and &ldquo;popular&rdquo; writers, but even from certain
&ldquo;prudent and exact physicists.&rdquo; But there would
be just as much reason to deny the existence of ponderable
matter. As a matter of fact, there are metaphysicians
who accomplish even this feat, and whose
highest wisdom lies in denying or calling into question
the existence of an external universe; according
to them only one real entity exists&mdash;their own
precious personality, or, to be more correct, their immortal
soul. Several modern physiologists have embraced
this ultra-idealist view, which is to be found
in Descartes, Berkeley, Fichte, and others. Their
&ldquo;psycho-monism&rdquo; affirms: &ldquo;One thing only exists,
and that is my own mind.&rdquo; This audacious spiritualism
seems to us to rest on an erroneous inference from
Kant&rsquo;s correct critical theory, that we can know the
outer world only in the phenomenal aspect which is
accessible to our human organs of thought&mdash;the brain
and the organs of sense. If by those means we can
attain only an imperfect and limited knowledge of the
material world, that is no reason for denying its existence
altogether. In my opinion, the existence of ether
is as certain as that of ponderable matter&mdash;as certain
as my own existence, as I reflect and write on it. As
we assure ourselves of the existence of ponderable matter
by its mass and weight, by chemical and mechanical
experiments, so we prove that of ether by the experiences
and experiments of optics and electricity.</p>

<p>Although, however, the existence of ether is now
regarded as a positive fact by nearly all physicists,
and although many effects of this remarkable substance
are familiar to us through an extensive experi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>ence,
especially in the way of optical and electrical
experiments, yet we are still far from being clear and
confident as to its real character. The views of the
most eminent physicists, who have made a special
study of it, are extremely divergent; they frequently
contradict each other on the most important points.
One is, therefore, free to choose among the contradictory
hypotheses according to one&rsquo;s knowledge and
judgment. I will put in the following eight theses
the view which has approved itself to me after mature
reflection on the subject, though I am no expert in
this department:</p>

<p>I. Ether fills the whole of space, in so far as it is
not occupied by ponderable matter, as a <i>continuous
substance</i>; it fully occupies the space between the
atoms of ponderable matter.</p>

<p>II. Ether has probably no chemical quality, and
is not composed of atoms. If it be supposed that it
consists of minute homogeneous atoms (for instance,
indivisible etheric particles of a uniform size), it must
be further supposed that there is something else between
these atoms, either &ldquo;empty space&rdquo; or a third,
completely unknown medium, a purely hypothetical
&ldquo;interether&rdquo;; the question as to the nature of this
brings us back to the original difficulty, and so on <i>in
infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>III. As the idea of an empty space and an action
at a distance is scarcely possible in the present condition
of our knowledge (at least it does not help to a
clear monistic view), I postulate for ether a special
structure which is not atomistic, like that of ponderable
matter, and which may provisionally be called (without
further determination) <i>etheric</i> or <i>dynamic</i> structure.</p>

<p>IV. The consistency of ether is also peculiar, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
our hypothesis, and different from that of ponderable
matter. It is neither gaseous, as some conceive, nor
solid, as others suppose; the best idea of it can be
formed by comparison with an extremely attenuated,
elastic, and light jelly.</p>

<p>V. Ether may be called <i>imponderable</i> matter in the
sense that we have no means of determining its weight
experimentally. If it really has weight, as is very
probable, it must be so slight as to be far below the
capacity of our most delicate balance. Some physicists
have attempted to determine its weight by the
energy of the light-waves, and have discovered that it
is some fifteen trillion times lighter than atmospheric
air; on that hypothesis a sphere of ether of the size of
our earth would weigh at least two hundred and fifty
pounds(?).</p>

<p>VI. The etheric consistency may probably (in accordance
with the pyknotic theory) pass into the gaseous
state under certain conditions by progressive condensation,
just as a gas may be converted into a fluid,
and ultimately into a solid, by lowering its temperature.</p>

<p>VII. Consequently, these three conditions of matter
may be arranged (and it is a point of great importance
in our monistic cosmogony) in a genetic, continuous
order. We may distinguish five stages in it: (1)
the etheric, (2) the gaseous, (3) the fluid, (4) the viscous
(in the living protoplasm), and (5) the solid state.</p>

<p>VIII. Ether is boundless and immeasurable, like
the space it occupies. It is in eternal motion; and
this specific movement of ether (it is immaterial whether
we conceive it as vibration, strain, condensation, etc.),
in reciprocal action with mass-movement (or gravitation),
is the ultimate cause of all phenomena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The great question of the nature of ether,&rdquo; as
Hertz justly calls it, includes the question of its relation
to ponderable matter; for these two forms of
matter are not only always in the closest external contact,
but also in eternal, dynamic, reciprocal action.
We may divide the most general phenomena of nature,
which are distinguished by physics as natural forces
or &ldquo;functions of matter,&rdquo; into two groups; the first of
them may be regarded mainly (though not exclusively)
as a function of ether, and the second a function of
ponderable matter&mdash;as in the following scheme which
I take from my <i>Monism</i>:</p>

<table summary="" class="ruled">
<caption><span class="smcap">The World (Nature, or the Cosmos)</span></caption>

<tbody>
<tr><th><span class="smcap">Ether</span>&mdash;Imponderable.</th>
<th><span class="smcap">Mass</span>&mdash;Ponderable.</th></tr>
<tr><td><p class="center">1. <i>Consistency</i>:</p>
<p class="hanging">Etheric (<i>i.e.</i>, neither gaseous nor fluid, nor solid).</p></td>
<td><p class="center">1. <i>Consistency</i>:</p>
<p class="hanging">Not etheric (but gaseous, fluid, or solid).</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p class="center">2. <i>Structure</i>:</p>
<p class="hanging">Not atomistic, not made up of separate particles (atoms), but continuous.</p></td>
<td><p class="center">2. <i>Structure</i>:</p>
<p class="hanging">Atomistic, made up of infinitesimal, distinct particles (atoms) discontinuous.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p class="center">3. <i>Chief Functions</i>:</p>
<p class="hanging">Light, radiant heat, electricity, and magnetism. </p></td>
<td><p class="center">3. <i>Chief Functions</i>:</p>
<p class="hanging">Gravity, inertia, molecular heat, and chemical affinity.</p></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The two groups of functions of matter, which we have
opposed in this table, may, to some extent, be regarded
as the outcome of the first &ldquo;division of labor&rdquo; in the
development of matter, the &ldquo;primary ergonomy of
matter.&rdquo; But this distinction must not be supposed
to involve an absolute separation of the two antithetic
groups; they always retain their connection, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
in constant reciprocal action. It is well known that
the optical and electrical phenomena of ether are closely
connected with mechanical and chemical changes
in ponderable elements; the radiant heat of ether may
be directly converted into the mechanical heat of the
mass; gravitation is impossible unless the ether effects
the mutual attraction of the separated atoms, because
we cannot admit the idea of an <i>actio in distans</i>. In
like manner, the conversion of one form of energy into
another, as indicated in the law of the persistence of
force, illustrates the constant reciprocity of the two
chief types of substance, ether and mass.</p>

<p>The great law of nature, which, under the title of the
&ldquo;law of substance,&rdquo; we put at the head of all physical
considerations, was conceived as the law of &ldquo;the persistence
of force&rdquo; by Robert Meyer, who first formulated it,
and Helmholtz, who continued the work. Another German
scientist, Friedrich Mohr, of Bonn, had clearly
outlined it in its main features ten years earlier (1837).
The old idea of <i>force</i> was, after a time, differentiated
by modern physics from that of <i>energy</i>, which was at
first synonymous with it. Hence the law is now usually
called the &ldquo;law of the persistence of energy.&rdquo; However,
this finer distinction need not enter into the general
consideration, to which I must confine myself here,
and into the question of the great principle of the &ldquo;persistence
of substance.&rdquo; The interested reader will find
a very clear treatment of the question in Tyndall&rsquo;s excellent
paper on &ldquo;The Fundamental Law of Nature,&rdquo;
in his <i>Fragments of Science</i>. It fully explains the
broad significance of this profound cosmic law, and
points out its application to the main problems of very
different branches of science. We shall confine our
attention to the important fact that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>&ldquo;principle of
energy&rdquo; and the correlative idea of the unity of natural
forces, on the basis of a common origin, are now
accepted by all competent physicists, and are regarded
as the greatest advance of physics in the nineteenth
century. We now know that heat, sound, light,
chemical action, electricity, and magnetism are all
modes of motion. We can, by a certain apparatus,
convert any one of these forces into another, and prove
by an accurate measurement that not a single particle
of energy is lost in the process.</p>

<p>The sum-total of force or energy in the universe remains
constant, no matter what changes take place
around us; it is eternal and infinite, like the matter
on which it is inseparably dependent. The whole
drama of nature apparently consists in an alternation
of movement and repose; yet the bodies at rest have
an inalienable quantity of force, just as truly as those
that are in motion. It is in this movement that the
potential energy of the former is converted into the
kinetic energy of the latter. &ldquo;As the principle of the
persistence of force takes into account repulsion as
well as attraction, it affirms that the mechanical value
of the potential energy and the kinetic energy in the
material world is a constant quantity. To put it briefly,
the force of the universe is divided into two parts,
which may be mutually converted, according to a fixed
relation of value. The diminution of the one involves
the increase of the other; the total value remains unchanged
in the universe.&rdquo; The potential energy and
the actual, or kinetic, energy are being continually
transformed from one condition to the other; but the
infinite sum of force in the world at large never suffers
the slightest curtailment.</p>

<p>Once modern physics had established the law of sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>stance
as far as the simpler relations of inorganic bodies
are concerned, physiology took up the story, and
proved its application to the entire province of the organic
world. It showed that all the vital activities
of the organism&mdash;without exception&mdash;are based on a
constant &ldquo;reciprocity of force&rdquo; and a correlative change
of material, or metabolism, just as much as the simplest
processes in &ldquo;lifeless&rdquo; bodies. Not only the growth
and the nutrition of plants and animals, but even their
functions of sensation and movement, their sense-action
and psychic life, depend on the conversion of potential
into kinetic energy, and <i>vice versâ</i>. This supreme
law dominates also those elaborate performances of
the nervous system which we call, in the higher animals
and man, &ldquo;the action of the mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our monistic view, that the great cosmic law applies
throughout the whole of nature, is of the highest moment.
For it not only involves, on its positive side,
the essential unity of the cosmos and the causal connection
of all phenomena that come within our cognizance,
but it also, in a negative way, marks the highest
intellectual progress, in that it definitely rules out the
three central dogmas of metaphysics&mdash;God, freedom,
and immortality. In assigning mechanical causes to
phenomena everywhere, the law of substance comes
into line with the universal law of causality.</p>

<p>The greatest, vastest, and most difficult of all cosmic
problems is that of the origin and development
of the world&mdash;the &ldquo;question of creation,&rdquo; in a
word. Even to the solution of this most difficult world-riddle
the nineteenth century has contributed more than
all its predecessors; in a certain sense, indeed, it has
found the solution. We have at least attained to a
clear view of the fact that all the partial questions of
creation are indivisibly connected, that they represent
one single, comprehensive &ldquo;cosmic problem,&rdquo; and that
the key to this problem is found in the one magic
word&mdash;evolution. The great questions of the creation
of man, the creation of the animals and plants,
the creation of the earth and the sun, etc., are all
parts of the general question, What is the origin of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
whole world? Has it been <i>created</i> by supernatural
power, or has it been <i>evolved</i> by a natural process? What
are the causes and the manner of this evolution? If
we succeed in finding the correct answer to one of these
questions, we have, according to our monistic conception
of the world, cast a brilliant light on the solution
of them all, and on the entire cosmic problem.</p>

<p>The current opinion as to the origin of the world in
earlier ages was almost a universal belief in creation.
This belief has been expressed in thousands of interesting,
more or less fabulous, legends, poems, cosmogonies,
and myths. A few great philosophers were devoid
of it, especially those remarkable free-thinkers of
classical antiquity who first conceived the idea of natural
evolution. All the creation-myths, on the contrary,
were of a supernatural, miraculous, and transcendental
character. Incompetent, as it was, to investigate
for itself the nature of the world and its origin
by natural causes, the undeveloped mind naturally
had recourse to the idea of miracle. In most of these
creation-myths <i>anthropism</i> was blended with the belief
in the miraculous. The creator was supposed to have
constructed the world on a definite plan, just as man
accomplishes his artificial constructions; the conception
of the creator was generally completely anthropomorphic,
a palpable &ldquo;anthropistic creationism.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;all-mighty maker of heaven and earth,&rdquo; as he is called
in Genesis and the Catechism, is just as humanly conceived
as the modern creator of Agassiz and Reinke,
or the intelligent &ldquo;engineer&rdquo; of other recent biologists.</p>

<p>Entering more fully into the notion of creation, we
can distinguish as two entirely different acts the production
of the universe as a whole and the partial production
of its various parts, in harmony with Spinoza&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
idea of <i>substance</i> (the universe) and <i>accidents</i> (or <i>modes</i>,
the individual phenomena of substance). This distinction
is of great importance, because there are many
eminent philosophers who admit the one and reject the
other.</p>

<p>According to this creationist theory, then, God has
&ldquo;made the world out of nothing.&rdquo; It is supposed
that God (a rational, but immaterial, being) existed
by himself for an eternity before he resolved to create
the world. Some supporters of the theory restrict God&rsquo;s
creative function to one single act; they believe that
this extramundane God (the rest of whose life is shrouded
in mystery) created the substance of the world in a
single moment, endowed it with the faculty of the most
extensive evolution, and troubled no further about it.
This view may be found, for instance, in the English
Deists in many forms. It approaches very close to our
monistic theory of evolution, only abandoning it in the
one instant in which God accomplished the creation.
Other creationists contend that God did not confine
himself to the mere creation of matter, but that he
continues to be operative as the &ldquo;sustainer and ruler
of the world.&rdquo; Different modifications of this belief
are found, some approaching very close to <i>pantheism</i>
and others to complete <i>theism</i>. All these and similar
forms of belief in creation are incompatible with the
law of the persistence of matter and force; that law
knows nothing of a beginning.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that E. du Bois-Reymond has
identified himself with this cosmological creationism
in his latest speech (on &ldquo;Neovitalism,&rdquo; 1894). &ldquo;It is
more consonant with the divine omnipotence,&rdquo; he says,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>&ldquo;to assume that it created the whole material of the
world in one creative act unthinkable ages ago in such
wise that it should be endowed with inviolable laws to
control the origin and the progress of living things&mdash;that,
for instance, here on earth rudimentary organisms
should arise from which, without further assistance,
the whole of living nature could be evolved, from
a primitive bacillus to the graceful palm-wood, from a
primitive micrococcus to Solomon&rsquo;s lovely wives or to
the brain of Newton. Thus we are content with <i>one</i>
creative day, and we derive organic nature mechanically,
without the aid of either old or new vitalism.&rdquo;
Du Bois-Reymond here shows, as in the question of
consciousness, the shallow and illogical character of
his monistic thought.</p>

<p>According to another still prevalent theory, which
may be called &ldquo;ontological creationism,&rdquo; God not only
created the world at large, but also its separate contents.
In the Christian world the old Semitic legend of creation,
taken from Genesis, is still very widely accepted;
even among modern scientists it finds an adherent
here and there. I have fully entered into the criticism
of it in the first chapter of my <i>Natural History of Creation</i>.
The following theories may be enumerated as
the most interesting modifications of this ontological
creationism:</p>

<p>I. <i>Dualistic creation.</i>&mdash;God restricted his interference
to <i>two</i> creative acts. First he created the inorganic
world, mere dead substance, to which alone the law of
energy applies, working blindly and aimlessly in the
mechanism of material things and the building of the
mountains; then God attained intelligence and communicated
it to the purposive intelligent forces which
initiate and control organic evolution.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>II. <i>Trialistic creation.</i>&mdash;God made the world in <i>three</i>
creative acts: (<i>a</i>) the creation of the heavens&mdash;the extra-terrestrial
world, (<i>b</i>) the creation of the earth (as
the centre of the world) and of its living inhabitants,
and (<i>c</i>) the creation of man (in the image and likeness
of God). This dogma is still widely prevalent among
theologians and other &ldquo;educated&rdquo; people; it is taught
as the truth in many of our schools.</p>

<p>III. <i>Heptameral creation</i>; a creation in seven days
(<i>teste</i> Moses).&mdash;Although few educated people really
believe in this Mosaic myth now, it is still firmly impressed
on our children in the biblical lessons of their
earliest years. The numerous attempts that have been
made, especially in England, to harmonize it with the
modern theory of evolution have entirely failed. It
obtained some importance in science when Linné adopted
it in the establishment of his system, and based his
definition of organic species (which he considered to be
unchangeable) on it: &ldquo;There are as many different
species of animals and plants as there were different
forms created in the beginning by the Infinite.&rdquo; This
dogma was pretty generally held until the time of
Darwin (1859), although Lamarck had already proved
its untenability in 1809.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Periodic creation.</i>&mdash;At the beginning of each
period of the earth&rsquo;s history the whole population of
animals and plants was created anew, and destroyed
by a general catastrophe at its close; there were as
many general creative acts as there are distinct geological
periods (the catastrophic theory of Cuvier [1818]
and Louis Agassiz [1858]). Palæontology, which
seemed to support this theory in its more imperfect
stage, has since completely refuted it.</p>

<p>V. <i>Individual creation.</i>&mdash;Every single man&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
every individual animal and plant&mdash;does not arise by
a natural process of growth, but is created by the favor
of God. This view of creation is still often met with
in journals, especially in the &ldquo;births&rdquo; column. The
special talents and features of our children are often
gratefully acknowledged to be &ldquo;gifts of God&rdquo;; their
hereditary defects fit into another theory.</p>

<p>The error of these creation-legends and the cognate
belief in miracles must have been apparent to thoughtful
minds at an early period; more than two thousand
years ago we find that many attempts were made to
replace them by a rational theory, and to explain the
origin of the world by natural causes. In the front
rank, once more, we must place the leaders of the Ionic
school, with Democritus, Heraclitus, Empedocles, Aristotle,
Lucretius, and other ancient philosophers. The
first imperfect attempts which they made astonish
us, in a measure, by the flashes of mental light in
which they anticipate modern ideas. It must be remembered
that classical antiquity had not that solid
groundwork for scientific speculation which has been
provided by the countless observations and experiments
of modern scientists. During the Middle Ages&mdash;especially
during the domination of the papacy&mdash;scientific
work in this direction entirely ceased. The torture
and the stake of the Inquisition insured that an
unconditional belief in the Hebrew mythology should
be the final answer to all the questions of creation.
Even the phenomena which led directly to the observation
of the <i>facts</i> of evolution&mdash;the embryology of the
plant and the animal, and of man&mdash;remained unnoticed,
or only excited the interest of an occasional
keen observer; but their discoveries were ignored or
forgotten. Moreover, the path to a correct knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
of natural development was barred by the dominant
theory of preformation, the dogma which held that the
characteristic form and structure of each animal and
plant were already sketched in miniature in the germ
(cf. <a href="#Page_54">p. 54</a>).</p>

<p>The science which we now call the science of evolution
(in the broadest sense) is, both in its general outline
and in its separate parts, a child of the nineteenth
century; it is one of its most momentous and most
brilliant achievements. Almost unknown in the preceding
century, this theory has now become the sure
foundation of our whole world-system. I have treated
it exhaustively in my <i>General Morphology</i> (1866), more
popularly in my <i>Natural History of Creation</i> (1868),
and in its special application to man in my <i>Anthropogeny</i>
(1874). Here I shall restrict myself to a brief
survey of the chief advances which the science has made
in the course of the century. It falls into four sections,
according to the nature of its object; that is, it deals
with the natural origin of (1) the cosmos, (2) the earth,
(3) terrestrial forms of life, and (4) man.</p>

<h3>I.&mdash;MONISTIC COSMOGONY</h3>

<p>The first attempt to explain the constitution and the
mechanical origin of the world in a simple manner by
&ldquo;Newtonian laws&rdquo;&mdash;that is, by mathematical and
physical laws&mdash;was made by Immanuel Kant in the
famous work of his youth (1755), <i>General History of
the Earth and Theory of the Heavens</i>. Unfortunately,
this distinguished and daring work remained almost
unknown for ninety years; it was only disinterred in
1845 by Alexander Humboldt in the first volume of
his <i>Cosmos</i>. In the mean time the great French math<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>ematician,
Pierre Laplace, had arrived independently
at similar views to those of Kant, and he gave them
a mathematical foundation in his <i>Exposition du Système
du Monde</i> (1796). His chief work, the <i>Mécanique
Céleste</i>, appeared a hundred years ago. The analogous
features of the cosmogony of Kant and Laplace
consist, as is well known, in a mechanical explanation
of the movements of the planets, and the conclusion
which is drawn therefrom, that all the cosmic
bodies were formed originally by a condensation of
rotating nebulous spheres. This &ldquo;nebular hypothesis&rdquo;
has been much improved and supplemented since,
but it is still the best of all the attempts to explain the
origin of the world on monistic and mechanical lines.
It has recently been strongly confirmed and enlarged
by the theory that this cosmogonic process did not
simply take place once, but is periodically repeated.
While new cosmic bodies arise and develop out of rotating
masses of nebula in some parts of the universe,
in other parts old, extinct, frigid suns come into collision,
and are once more reduced by the heat generated
to the condition of nebulæ.</p>

<p>Nearly all the older and the more recent cosmogonies,
including most of those which were inspired by
Kant and Laplace, started from the popular idea that
the world had had a beginning. Hence, according to a
widespread version of the nebular hypothesis, &ldquo;in the
beginning&rdquo; was made a vast nebula of infinitely attenuated
and light material, and at a certain moment
(&ldquo;countless ages ago&rdquo;) a movement of rotation was
imparted to this mass. Given this &ldquo;first beginning&rdquo;
of the cosmogonic movement, it is easy, on mechanical
principles, to deduce and mathematically establish the
further phenomena of the formation of the cosmic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
bodies, the separation of the planets, and so forth.
This first &ldquo;origin of movement&rdquo; is Du Bois-Reymond&rsquo;s
second &ldquo;world-enigma&rdquo;; he regards it as transcendental.
Many other scientists and philosophers are
equally helpless before this difficulty; they resign
themselves to the notion that we have here a primary
&ldquo;supernatural impetus&rdquo; to the scheme of things, a
&ldquo;miracle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In our opinion, this second &ldquo;world-enigma&rdquo; is
solved by the recognition that movement is as innate
and original a property of substance as is sensation.
The proof of this monistic assumption is found, first,
in the law of substance, and, secondly, in the discoveries
which astronomy and physics have made in the
latter half of the century. By the spectral analysis of
Bunsen and Kirchhoff (1860) we have found, not only
that the millions of bodies, which fill the infinity of
space, are of the same material as our own sun and
earth, but also that they are in various stages of evolution;
we have obtained by its aid information as to
the movements and distances of the stars, which the
telescope would never have given us. Moreover, the
telescope itself has been vastly improved, and has, in
alliance with photography, made a host of scientific
discoveries of which no one dreamed at the beginning
of the century. In particular, a closer acquaintance
with comets, meteorites, star-clusters, and nebulæ has
helped us to realize the great significance of the smaller
bodies which are found in millions in the space between
the stars.</p>

<p>We now know that the <i>paths</i> of the millions of heavenly
bodies are <i>changeable</i>, and to some extent irregular,
whereas the planetary system was formerly thought
to be constant, and the rotating spheres were described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
as pursuing their orbits in eternal regularity. Astro-physics
owes much of its triumph to the immense progress
of other branches of physics, of optics, and electricity,
and especially of the theory of ether. And here,
again, our supreme law of substance is found to be one
of the most valuable achievements of modern science.
We now know that it rules unconditionally in the most
distant reaches of space, just as it does in our planetary
system, in the most minute particle of the earth as
well as in the smallest cell of our human frame. We
are, moreover, justified in concluding, if we are not
logically compelled to conclude, that the persistence
of matter and force has held good throughout all time
as it does to-day. Through all eternity the infinite
universe has been, and is, subject to the law of substance.</p>

<p>From this great progress of astronomy and physics,
which mutually elucidate and supplement each other,
we draw a series of most important conclusions with
regard to the constitution and evolution of the cosmos,
and the persistence and transformation of substance.
Let us put them briefly in the following theses:</p>

<p>I. The <i>extent</i> of the universe is infinite and unbounded;
it is empty in no part, but everywhere filled
with substance.</p>

<p>II. The <i>duration</i> of the world is equally infinite
and unbounded; it has no beginning and no end: it
is eternity.</p>

<p>III. Substance is everywhere and always in uninterrupted
movement and transformation: nowhere is
there perfect repose and rigidity; yet the infinite quantity
of matter and of eternally changing force remains
constant.</p>

<p>IV. This universal movement of substance in space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
takes the form of an eternal cycle or of a periodical process
of evolution.</p>

<p>V. The phases of this evolution consist in a periodic
change of consistency, of which the first outcome
is the primary division into mass and ether&mdash;the ergonomy
of ponderable and imponderable matter.</p>

<p>VI. This division is effected by a progressive condensation
of matter as the formation of countless infinitesimal
&ldquo;centres of condensation,&rdquo; in which the inherent
primitive properties of substance&mdash;feeling and
inclination&mdash;are the active causes.</p>

<p>VII. While minute and then larger bodies are being
formed by this pyknotic process in one part of space,
and the intermediate ether increases its strain, the opposite
process&mdash;the destruction of cosmic bodies by
collision&mdash;is taking place in another quarter.</p>

<p>VIII. The immense quantity of heat which is generated
in this mechanical process of the collision of
swiftly moving bodies represents the new kinetic energy
which effects the movement of the resultant nebulæ
and the construction of new rotating bodies. The
eternal drama begins afresh. Even our mother earth,
which was formed of part of the gyrating solar system
millions of ages ago, will grow cold and lifeless after
the lapse of further millions, and, gradually narrowing
its orbit, will fall eventually into the sun.</p>

<p>It seems to me that these modern discoveries as to
the periodic decay and re-birth of cosmic bodies, which
we owe to the most recent advance of physics and astronomy,
associated with the law of substance, are
especially important in giving us a clear insight into
the universal cosmic process of evolution. In their
light our earth shrinks into the slender proportions
of a &ldquo;mote in the sunbeam,&rdquo; of which unnumbered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
millions chase each other through the vast depths of
space. Our own &ldquo;human nature,&rdquo; which exalted itself
into an image of God in its anthropistic illusion, sinks
to the level of a placental mammal, which has no more
value for the universe at large than the ant, the fly of
a summer&rsquo;s day, the microscopic infusorium, or the
smallest bacillus. Humanity is but a transitory phase
of the evolution of an eternal substance, a particular
phenomenal form of matter and energy, the true proportion
of which we soon perceive when we set it on
the background of infinite space and eternal time.</p>

<p>Since Kant explained space and time to be merely
&ldquo;forms of perception&rdquo;&mdash;space the form of external,
time of internal, sensitivity&mdash;there has been a keen
controversy, which still continues, over this important
problem. A large section of modern metaphysicians
have persuaded themselves that this &ldquo;critical fact&rdquo;
possesses a great importance as the starting-point of
&ldquo;a purely idealist theory of knowledge,&rdquo; and that, consequently,
the natural opinion of the ordinary healthy
mind as to the <i>reality</i> of time and space is swept aside.
This narrow and ultra-idealist conception of time
and space has become a prolific source of error. It
overlooks the fact that Kant only touched one side
of the problem, the <i>subjective</i> side, in that theory, and
recognized the equal validity of its <i>objective</i> side.
&ldquo;Time and space,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have empirical reality, but
transcendental ideality.&rdquo; Our modern monism is quite
compatible with this thesis of Kant&rsquo;s, but not with the
one-sided exaggeration of the subjective aspect of the
problem; the latter leads logically to the absurd idealism
that culminates in Berkeley&rsquo;s thesis, &ldquo;Bodies are
but ideas; their essence is in their perception.&rdquo; The
thesis should be read thus: &ldquo;Bodies are only ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
for my personal consciousness; their existence is just
as real as that of my organs of thought, the ganglionic
cells in the gray bed of my brain, which receive the impress
of bodies on my sense-organs and form those
ideas by association of the impressions.&rdquo; It is just
as easy to doubt or to deny the reality of my own consciousness
as to doubt that of time and space. In the
delirium of fever, in hallucinations, in dreams, and in
double-consciousness, I take ideas to be true which are
merely fancies. I mistake my own personality for
another (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page_185">p. 185</a>); Descartes&rsquo; famous <i>Cogito ergo
sum</i> applies no longer. On the other hand, the reality
of time and space is now fully established by that
expansion of our philosophy which we owe to the law
of substance and to our monistic cosmogony. When
we have happily got rid of the untenable idea of
&ldquo;empty space,&rdquo; there remains as the infinite &ldquo;space-filling&rdquo;-medium
matter, in its two forms of ether and
mass. So also we find a &ldquo;time-filling&rdquo; event in the
eternal movement, or genetic energy, which reveals
itself in the uninterrupted evolution of substance, in
the <i>perpetuum mobile</i> of the universe.</p>

<p>As a body which has been set in motion continues
to move as long as no external agency interferes with
it, the idea was conceived long ago of constructing an
apparatus which should illustrate perpetual motion.
The fact was overlooked that every movement meets
with external impediments and gradually ceases, unless
a new impetus is given to it from without and a
new force is introduced to counteract the impediments.
Thus, for instance, a pendulum would swing backward
and forward for an eternity at the same speed if
the resistance of the atmosphere and the friction at
the point it hangs from did not gradually deprive it of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
the mechanical kinetic energy of its motion and convert
it into heat. We have to furnish it with fresh
mechanical energy by a spring (or, as in the pendulum-clock,
by the drag of a weight). Hence it is impossible
to construct a machine that would produce, without
external aid, a surplus of energy by which it could
keep itself going. Every attempt to make such a <i>perpetuum
mobile</i> must necessarily fail; the discovery of
the law of substance showed, in addition, the theoretical
impossibility of it.</p>

<p>The case is different, however, when we turn to the
world at large, the boundless universe that is in eternal
movement. The infinite matter, which fills it objectively,
is what we call <i>space</i> in our subjective impression
of it; <i>time</i> is our subjective conception of its eternal
movement, which is, objectively, a periodic, cyclic evolution.
These two &ldquo;forms of perception&rdquo; teach us the
infinity and eternity of the universe. That is, moreover,
equal to saying that the universe itself is a <i>perpetuum
mobile</i>. This infinite and eternal &ldquo;machine
of the universe&rdquo; sustains itself in eternal and uninterrupted
movement, because every impediment is compensated
by an &ldquo;equivalence of energy,&rdquo; and the unlimited
sum of kinetic and potential energy remains
always the same. The law of the persistence of force
proves also that the idea of a <i>perpetuum mobile</i> is just as
applicable to, and as significant for, the cosmos as a
whole as it is impossible for the isolated action of any
part of it. Hence the theory of <i>entropy</i> is likewise untenable.</p>

<p>The able founder of the mechanical theory of heat
(1850), Clausius, embodied the momentous contents of
this important theory in two theses. The first runs:
&ldquo;The energy of the universe is constant&rdquo;&mdash;that is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>-half
of our law of substance, the principle of energy
(<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page_230">p. 230</a>). The second thesis is: &ldquo;The energy of
the universe tends towards a maximum.&rdquo; In my opinion
this second assertion is just as erroneous as the
first is true. In the theory of Clausius the entire energy
of the universe is of two kinds, one of which (heat of
the higher degree, mechanical, electrical, chemical
energy, etc.) is partly convertible into work, but the
other is not; the latter energy, already converted into
heat and distributed in the cooler masses, is irrevocably
lost as far as any further work is concerned.
Clausius calls this unconsumed energy, which is no
longer available for mechanical work, <i>entropy</i> (that is,
force that is directed <i>inward</i>); it is continually increasing
at the cost of the other half. As, therefore,
the mechanical energy of the universe is daily being
transformed into heat, and this cannot be reconverted
into mechanical force, the sum of heat and energy in
the universe must continually tend to be reduced and
dissipated. All difference of temperature must ultimately
disappear, and the completely latent heat must
be equally distributed through one inert mass of motionless
matter. All organic life and movement must
cease when this maximum of <i>entropy</i> has been reached.
That would be a real &ldquo;end of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If this theory of entropy were true, we should have
a &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; corresponding to this assumed &ldquo;end&rdquo;
of the world&mdash;a minimum of entropy, in which the differences
in temperature of the various parts of the cosmos
would be at a maximum. Both ideas are quite
untenable in the light of our monistic and consistent
theory of the eternal cosmogenetic process; both contradict
the law of substance. There is neither beginning
nor end of the world. The universe is infinite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
and eternally in motion; the conversion of kinetic into
potential energy, and <i>vicissim</i>, goes on uninterruptedly;
and the sum of this actual and potential energy
remains constant. The second thesis of the mechanical
theory of heat contradicts the first, and so must
be rejected.</p>

<p>The representatives of the theory of entropy are
quite correct as long as they confine themselves to distinct
processes, in which, <i>under certain conditions</i>, the
latent heat cannot be reconverted into work. Thus,
for instance, in the steam-engine the heat can only be
converted into mechanical work when it passes from
a warmer body (steam) into a cooler (water); the process
cannot be reversed. In the world at large, however,
quite other conditions obtain&mdash;conditions which permit
the reconversion of latent heat into mechanical
work. For instance, in the collision of two heavenly
bodies, which rush towards each other at inconceivable
speed, enormous quantities of heat are liberated, while
the pulverized masses are hurled and scattered about
space. The eternal drama begins afresh&mdash;the rotating
mass, the condensation of its parts, the formation
of new meteorites, their combination into larger bodies,
and so on.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;MONISTIC GEOGENY</h3>

<p>The history of the earth, of which we are now going
to make a brief survey, is only a minute section of the
history of the cosmos. Like the latter, it has been the
object of philosophic speculation and mythological fantasy
for many thousand years. Its true scientific study,
however, is much younger; it belongs, for the most
part, to the nineteenth century. The fact that the
earth is a planet revolving round the sun was deter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>mined
by the system of Copernicus (1543); Galilei,
Kepler, and other great astronomers, mathematically
determined its distance from the sun, the laws of its
motion, and so forth. Kant and Laplace indicated,
in their cosmogony, the way in which the earth had
been developed from the parent sun. But the later
history of the earth, the formation of its crust, the
origin of its seas and continents, its mountains and
deserts, was rarely made the subject of serious scientific
research in the eighteenth century, and in the first
two decades of the nineteenth. As a rule, men were
satisfied with unreliable conjectures or with the traditional
story of creation; once more the Mosaic legend
barred the way to an independent investigation.</p>

<p>In 1822 an important work appeared, which followed
the same method in the scientific investigation of the
history of the earth that had already proved the most
fertile&mdash;the <i>ontological</i> method, or the principle of &ldquo;actualism.&rdquo;
It consists in a careful study and manipulation
of <i>actual</i> phenomena with a view to the elucidation
of the analogous historical processes of the past. The
Society of Science at Göttingen had offered a prize in
1818 for &ldquo;the most searching and comprehensive inquiry
into the changes in the earth&rsquo;s crust which are
historically demonstrable, and the application which
may be made of a knowledge of them in the investigation
of the terrestrial revolutions which lie beyond
the range of history.&rdquo; This prize was obtained by
Karl Hoff, of Gotha, for his distinguished work, <i>History
of the Natural Changes in the Crust of the Earth in the
Light of Tradition</i> (1822-34). Sir Charles Lyell then
applied this <i>ontological</i> or <i>actualistic</i> method with great
success to the whole province of geology; his <i>Principles
of Geology</i> (1830) laid the firm foundation on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the fabric of the history of the earth was so happily
erected. The important geogenetic research of Alexander
Humboldt, Leopold Buch, Gustav Bischof, Edward
Süss, and other geologists, were wholly based on
the empirical foundation and the speculative principles
of Karl Hoff and Charles Lyell. They cleared the way
for purely rational science in the field of geology; they
removed the obstacles that had been put in the path
by mythological fancy and religious tradition, especially
by the Bible and its legends. I have already discussed
the merits of Lyell, and his relations with his
friend Charles Darwin, in the sixteenth and seventeenth
chapters of my <i>Natural History of Creation</i>, and must
refer the reader to the standard works on geology for
a further acquaintance with the history of the earth
and the great progress which dynamical and historical
geology have made during the century.</p>

<p>The first division of the history of the earth must
be a separation of inorganic and organic geogeny;
the latter begins with the first appearance of living
things on our planet. The earlier section, the inorganic
history of the earth, ran much the same course
as that of the other planets of our system. They were
all cast off as rings of nebula at the equator of the rotating
solar mass, and gradually condensed into independent
bodies. After cooling down a little, the glowing
ball of the earth was formed out of the gaseous mass,
and eventually, as the heat continued to radiate out
into space, there was formed at its surface the thin solid
crust on which we live. When the temperature at the
surface had gone down to a certain point, the water descended
upon it from the environing clouds of steam,
and thus the first condition was secured for the rise of
organic life. Many million years&mdash;certainly more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
than a hundred&mdash;have passed since this important
process of the formation of water took place, introducing
the third section of cosmogony, which we call <i>biogeny</i>.</p>

<h3>III.&mdash;MONISTIC BIOGENY</h3>

<p>The third phase of the evolution of the world opens
with the advent of organisms on our planet, and continues
uninterrupted from that point until the present
day. The great problems which this most interesting
part of the earth&rsquo;s history suggests to us were still
thought insoluble at the beginning of the nineteenth century,
or, at least, so difficult that their solution seemed to
be extremely remote. Now, at the close of the century,
we can affirm with legitimate pride that they have been
substantially solved by modern biology and its theory
of transformism; indeed, many of the phenomena of
the organic world are now interpreted on physical principles
as completely as the familiar physical phenomena
of inorganic nature. The merit of making the first
important step in this difficult path and of pointing out
the way to the monistic solution of all the problems of
biology must be accorded to the great French scientist,
Jean Lamarck; it was in 1809, the year of the birth of
Charles Darwin, that he published his famous <i>Philosophie
Zoologique</i>. In this original work not only is
a splendid effort made to interpret all the phenomena
of organic life from a monistic and physical point of
view, but the path is opened which alone leads to the
solution of the greatest enigma of this branch of science&mdash;the
problem of the natural origin of organic species.
Lamarck, who had an equally extensive empirical
acquaintance with zoology and botany, drew
the first sketch of the theory of descent; he showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
that all the countless members of the plant and animal
kingdoms have arisen by slow transformation from
simple, common ancestral types, and that it is the
gradual modification of forms by <i>adaptation</i>, in reciprocal
action with <i>heredity</i>, which has brought about
this secular metamorphosis.</p>

<p>I have fully appreciated the merit of Lamarck in the
fifth chapter, and of Darwin in the sixth and seventh
chapters, of the <i>Natural History of Creation</i>. Darwin,
fifty years afterwards, not only gave a solid foundation
to all the essential parts of the theory of descent,
but he filled up the <i>lacunae</i> of Lamarck&rsquo;s work by his
theory of selection. Darwin reaped abundantly the
success that Lamarck had never seen, with all his
merit. His epoch-making work on <i>The Origin of Species
by Natural Selection</i> has transformed modern biology
from its very foundations, in the course of the last
forty years, and has raised it to a stage of development
that yields to no other science in existence. Darwin is
<i>the Copernicus of the organic world</i>, as I said in 1868,
and E. du Bois-Reymond repeated fifteen years afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;MONISTIC ANTHROPOGENY</h3>

<p>The fourth and last phase of the world&rsquo;s history must
be for us men that latest period of time which has witnessed
the development of our own race. Lamarck
(1809) had already recognized that this evolution is
only rationally conceivable as the outcome of a natural
process, by &ldquo;descent from the apes,&rdquo; our next of kin
among the mammals. Huxley then proved, in his
famous essay on <i>The Place of Man in Nature</i>, that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
momentous thesis is an inevitable consequence of the
theory of descent, and is thoroughly established by
the facts of anatomy, embryology, and palæontology.
He considered this &ldquo;question of all questions&rdquo; to be
substantially answered. Darwin followed with a brilliant
discussion of the question under many aspects in
his <i>Descent of Man</i> (1871). I had myself devoted a
special chapter to this important problem of the science
of evolution in my <i>General Morphology</i> (1866). In
1874 I published my <i>Anthropogeny</i>, which contains
the first attempt to trace the descent of man through
the entire chain of his ancestry right up to the earliest
archigonous monera; the attempt was based equally
on the three great &ldquo;documents&rdquo; of evolutionary science&mdash;anatomy,
embryology, and palæontology. The
progress we have made in anthropogenetic research
during the last few years is described in the paper
which I read on &ldquo;Our Present Knowledge of the Origin
of Man&rdquo; at the International Congress of Zoologists
at Cambridge in 1898.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

THE UNITY OF NATURE</h2>

<p class="summary">The Monism of the Cosmos&mdash;Essential Unity of Organic and Inorganic
Nature&mdash;Carbon-Theory&mdash;The Hypothesis of Abiogenesis&mdash;Mechanical
and Purposive Causes&mdash;Mechanicism
and Teleology in Kant&rsquo;s Works&mdash;Design in the Organic and
Inorganic Worlds&mdash;Vitalism&mdash;Neovitalism&mdash;Dysteleology (the
Moral of the Rudimentary Organs)&mdash;Absence of Design in,
and Imperfection of, Nature&mdash;Telic Action in Organized Bodies&mdash;Its
Absence in Ontogeny and Phylogeny&mdash;The Platonist
&ldquo;Ideas&rdquo;&mdash;No Moral Order Discoverable in the History of the
Organic World, of the Vertebrates, or of the Human Race&mdash;Prevision&mdash;Design
and Chance</p>

<p>One of the first things to be proved by the law of
substance is the basic fact that any natural force
can be directly or indirectly converted into any other.
Mechanical and chemical energy, sound and heat, light
and electricity, are mutually convertible; they seem
to be but different modes of one and the same fundamental
force or <i>energy</i>. Thence follows the important
thesis of the unity of all natural forces, or, as it may
also be expressed, the &ldquo;monism of energy.&rdquo; This fundamental
principle is now generally recognized in the
entire province of physics and chemistry, as far as it
applies to inorganic substances.</p>

<p>It seems to be otherwise with the organic world and
its wealth of color and form. It is, of course, obvious
that a great part of the phenomena of life may be im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>mediately
traced to mechanical and chemical energy,
and to the effects of electricity and light. For other
vital processes, however, especially for psychic activity
and consciousness, such an interpretation is vigorously
contested. Yet the modern science of evolution has
achieved the task of constructing a bridge between
these two apparently irreconcilable provinces. We are
now certain that all the phenomena of organic life are
subject to the universal law of substance no less than
the phenomena of the inorganic universe.</p>

<p>The unity of nature which necessarily follows, and
the demolition of the earlier dualism, are certainly
among the most valuable results of modern evolution.
Thirty-three years ago I made an exhaustive effort to
establish this &ldquo;monism of the cosmos&rdquo; and the essential
unity of organic and inorganic nature by a
thorough, critical demonstration, and a comparison of
the accordance of these two great divisions of nature
with regard to matter, form, and force.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> A short epitome
of the result is given in the fifteenth chapter of
my <i>Natural History of Creation</i>. The views I put
forward are accepted by the majority of modern scientists,
but an attempt has been made in many quarters
lately to dispute them and to maintain the old antithesis
of the two divisions of nature. The ablest of
these is to be found in the recent <i>Welt als That</i> of the
botanist Reinke. It defends <i>pure cosmological</i> dualism
with admirable lucidity and consistency, and only
goes to prove how utterly untenable the teleological
system is that is connected therewith. According to
the author, physical and chemical forces alone are at
work in the entire field of inorganic nature, while in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the organic world we find &ldquo;intelligent forces,&rdquo; regulative
or dominant forces. The law of substance is supposed
to apply to the one, but not to the other. On
the whole, it is a question of the old antithesis of a
mechanical and a teleological system. But before we
go more fully into it, let us glance briefly at two other
theories, which seem to me to be of great importance
in the decision of that controversy&mdash;the carbon-theory
and the theory of spontaneous generation.</p>

<p>Physiological chemistry has, after countless analyses,
established the following five facts during the last
forty years:</p>

<p>I. No other elements are found in organic bodies
than those of the inorganic world.</p>

<p>II. The combinations of elements which are peculiar
to organisms, and which are responsible for their
vital phenomena, are compound protoplasmic substances,
of the group of albuminates.</p>

<p>III. Organic life itself is a chemico-physical process,
based on the metabolism (or interchange of material)
of these albuminates.</p>

<p>IV. The only element which is capable of building
up these compound albuminates, in combination with
other elements (oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulphur),
is carbon.</p>

<p>V. These protoplasmic compounds of carbon are
distinguished from most other chemical combinations
by their very intricate molecular structure, their instability,
and their jelly-like consistency.</p>

<p>On the basis of these five fundamental facts the following
&ldquo;carbon-theory&rdquo; was erected thirty-three years
ago: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>&ldquo;The peculiar chemico-physical properties of
carbon&mdash;especially the fluidity and the facility of decomposition
of the most elaborate albuminoid compounds
of carbon&mdash;are the sole and the mechanical
causes of the specific phenomena of movement, which
distinguish organic from inorganic substances, and
which are called life, in the usual sense of the word&rdquo;
(see <i>The Natural History of Creation</i>). Although this
&ldquo;carbon-theory&rdquo; is warmly disputed in some quarters,
no better monistic theory has yet appeared to replace
it. We have now a much better and more thorough
knowledge of the physiological relations of cell-life,
and of the chemistry and physics of the living protoplasm,
than we had thirty-three years ago, and so it is
possible to make a more confident and effective defence
of the carbon-theory.</p>

<p>The old idea of spontaneous generation is now taken
in many different senses. It is owing to this indistinctness
of the idea, and its application to so many
different hypotheses, that the problem is one of the most
contentious and confused of the science of the day. I
restrict the idea of spontaneous generation&mdash;also called
abiogenesis or archigony&mdash;to the first development of
living protoplasm out of inorganic carbonates, and distinguish
two phases in this &ldquo;beginning of biogenesis&rdquo;:
(1) <i>autogony</i>, or the rise of the simplest protoplasmic
substances in a formative fluid, and (2) <i>plasmogony</i>,
the differentiation of individual primitive organisms
out of these protoplasmic compounds, in the form of
<i>monera</i>. I have treated this important, though difficult,
problem so exhaustively in the fifteenth chapter
of my <i>Natural History of Creation</i> that I may content
myself here with referring to it. There is also a
very searching and severely scientific inquiry into it
in my <i>General Morphology</i> (1866). Naegeli has also
treated the hypothesis in quite the same sense in his
mechanico-physiological theory of descent (1884), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
has represented it to be an indispensable thesis in any
natural theory of evolution. I entirely agree with his
assertion that &ldquo;to reject abiogenesis is to admit a miracle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hypothesis of spontaneous generation and the
allied carbon-theory are of great importance in deciding
the long-standing conflict between the <i>teleological</i> (dualistic)
and the <i>mechanical</i> (monistic) interpretation
of phenomena. Since Darwin gave us the key to the
monistic explanation of organization in his theory of
selection forty years ago, it has become possible for us
to trace the splendid variety of orderly tendencies of
the organic world to mechanical, natural causes, just
as we could formerly in the inorganic world alone.
Hence the supernatural and telic forces, to which the
scientist had had recourse, have been rendered superfluous.
Modern metaphysics, however, continues to
regard the latter as indispensable and the former as
inadequate.</p>

<p>No philosopher has done more than Immanuel Kant
in defining the profound distinction between efficient
and final causes, with relation to the interpretation of
the whole cosmos. In his well-known earlier work
on <i>The General Natural History and Theory of the
Heavens</i> he made a bold attempt &ldquo;to treat the constitution
and the mechanical origin of the entire fabric
of the universe according to Newtonian laws.&rdquo; This
&ldquo;cosmological nebular theory&rdquo; was based entirely on
the mechanical phenomena of gravitation. It was expanded
and mathematically established later on by
Laplace. When the famous French astronomer was
asked by Napoleon I. where God, the creator and sustainer
of all things, came in in his system, he clearly
and honestly replied: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>&ldquo;Sire, I have managed without
that hypothesis.&rdquo; That indicated the atheistic
character which this mechanical cosmogony shares
with all the other inorganic sciences. This is the more
noteworthy because the theory of Kant and Laplace
is now almost universally accepted; every attempt to
supersede it has failed. When atheism is denounced
as a grave reproach, as it so often is, it is well to remember
that the reproach extends to the whole of modern
science, in so far as it gives a purely mechanical interpretation
of the inorganic world.</p>

<p>Mechanicism (in the Kantian sense) alone can give
us a true explanation of natural phenomena, for it
traces them to their real efficient causes, to blind and
unconscious agencies, which are determined in their
action only by the material constitution of the bodies
we are investigating. Kant himself emphatically
affirms that &ldquo;there can be no science without this mechanicism
of nature,&rdquo; and that the capacity of human
reason to give a mechanical interpretation of phenomena
is unlimited. But when he came subsequently to
give an elucidation of the complex phenomena of organic
nature in his <i>critique</i> of the teleological system,
he declared that these mechanical causes were inadequate;
that in this we must call <i>final causes</i> to our assistance.
It is true, he said, that even here we must
recognize the theoretical faculty of the mind to give a
mechanical interpretation, but its actual competence
to do so is restricted. He grants it this capacity to
some extent; but for the majority of the vital processes
(and especially for man&rsquo;s psychic activity) he thinks we
are bound to postulate <i>final</i> causes. The remarkable
§79 of the <i>critique</i> of judgment bears the characteristic
heading: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>&ldquo;On the Necessity for the Subordination
of the Mechanical Principle to the Teleological
in the Explanation of a Thing as a Natural End.&rdquo; It
seemed to Kant so impossible to explain the orderly
processes in the living organism without postulating
supernatural final causes (that is, a purposive creative
force) that he said: &ldquo;It is quite certain that we cannot
even satisfactorily understand, much less elucidate,
the nature of an organism and its internal faculty on
purely mechanical natural principles; it is so certain,
indeed, that we may confidently say, &lsquo;It is absurd for
a man to conceive the idea even that some day a Newton
will arise who can explain the origin of a single
blade of grass by natural laws which are uncontrolled
by design&rsquo;&mdash;such a hope is entirely forbidden us.&rdquo;
Seventy years afterwards this impossible &ldquo;Newton of
the organic world&rdquo; appeared in the person of Charles
Darwin, and achieved the great task that Kant had
deemed impracticable.</p>

<p>Since Newton (1682) formulated the law of gravitation,
and Kant (1755) established &ldquo;the constitution
and mechanical origin of the entire fabric of the world
on Newtonian laws,&rdquo; and Laplace (1796) provided a
mathematical foundation for this law of cosmic mechanicism,
the whole of the inorganic sciences have become
purely <i>mechanical</i>, and at the same time purely
<i>atheistic</i>. Astronomy, cosmogony, geology, meteorology,
and inorganic physics and chemistry are now absolutely
ruled by mechanical laws on a mathematical
foundation. The idea of &ldquo;design&rdquo; has wholly disappeared
from this vast province of science. At the close
of the nineteenth century, now that this monistic view
has fought its way to general recognition, no scientist
ever asks seriously of the &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; of any single
phenomenon in the whole of this great field. Is any
astronomer likely to inquire seriously to-day into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
purpose of planetary motion, or a mineralogist to seek
design in the structure of a crystal? Does the physicist
investigate the purpose of electric force, or the
chemist that of atomic weight? We may confidently
answer in the negative&mdash;certainly not, in the sense
that God, or a purposive natural force, had at some
time created these fundamental laws of the mechanism
of the universe with a definite design, and causes
them to work daily in accordance with his rational
will. The anthropomorphic notion of a deliberate
architect and ruler of the world has gone forever from
this field; the &ldquo;eternal, iron laws of nature&rdquo; have
taken his place.</p>

<p>But the idea of design has a very great significance
and application in the <i>organic</i> world. We do undeniably
perceive a purpose in the structure and in the life
of an organism. The plant and the animal seem to be
controlled by a definite design in the combination of
their several parts, just as clearly as we see in the machines
which man invents and constructs; as long as
life continues the functions of the several organs are
directed to definite ends, just as is the operation of the
various parts of a machine. Hence it was quite natural
that the older naïve study of nature, in explaining
the origin and activity of the living being, should postulate
a creator who had &ldquo;arranged all things with
wisdom and understanding,&rdquo; and had constructed each
plant and animal according to the special purpose of
its life. The conception of this &ldquo;almighty creator of
heaven and earth&rdquo; was usually quite anthropomorphic;
he created &ldquo;everything after its kind.&rdquo; As long
as the creator seemed to man to be of human shape, to
think with his brain, see with his eyes, and fashion
with his hands, it was possible to form a definite pict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>ure
of this &ldquo;divine engineer&rdquo; and his artistic work in
the great workshop of creation. This was not so easy
when the idea of God became refined, and man saw in
his &ldquo;invisible God&rdquo; a creator without organs&mdash;a gaseous
being. Still more unintelligible did these anthropomorphic
ideas become when physiology substituted
for the conscious, divine architect an unconscious,
creative &ldquo;vital force&rdquo;&mdash;a mysterious, purposive, natural
force, which differed from the familiar forces of
physics and chemistry, and only took these in part,
during life, into its service. This vitalism prevailed
until about the middle of the nineteenth century.
Johannes Müller, the great Berlin physiologist, was
the first to menace it with a destructive dose of facts.
It is true that the distinguished biologist had himself
(like all others in the first half of the century)
been educated in a belief in this vital force, and
deemed it indispensable for an elucidation of the ultimate
sources of life; nevertheless, in his classical and
still unrivalled <i>Manual of Physiology</i> (1833) he gave a
demonstrative proof that there is really nothing to be
said for this vital force. Müller himself, in a long
series of remarkable observations and experiments,
showed that most of the vital processes in the human
organism (and in the other animals) take place according
to physical and chemical laws, and that many
of them are capable of mathematical determination.
That was no less true of the animal functions of the
muscles and nerves, and of both the higher and the
lower sense-organs, than of the vegetal functions of
digestion, assimilation, and circulation. Only two
branches of the life of the organism, mental action and
reproduction, retained any element of mystery, and
seemed inexplicable without assuming a vital force.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
But immediately after Müller&rsquo;s death such important
discoveries and advances were made in these two
branches that the uneasy &ldquo;phantom of vital force&rdquo;
was driven from its last refuge. By a very remarkable
coincidence Johannes Müller died in the year 1858,
which saw the publication of Darwin&rsquo;s first communication
concerning his famous theory. The theory of
selection solved the great problem that had mastered
Müller&mdash;the question of the origin of orderly arrangements
from purely mechanical causes.</p>

<p>Darwin, as we have often said, had a twofold immortal
merit in the field of philosophy&mdash;firstly, the
reform of Lamarck&rsquo;s theory of descent, and its establishment
on the mass of facts accumulated in the
course of the half-century; secondly, the conception
of the theory of selection, which first revealed to us the
true causes of the gradual formation of species. Darwin
was the first to point out that the &ldquo;struggle for
life&rdquo; is the unconscious regulator which controls the
reciprocal action of heredity and adaptation in the
gradual transformation of species; it is the great &ldquo;selective
divinity&rdquo; which, by a purely &ldquo;natural choice,&rdquo;
without preconceived design, creates new forms, just
as selective man creates new types by an &ldquo;artificial
choice&rdquo; with a definite design. That gave us the solution
of the great philosophic problem: &ldquo;How can purposive
contrivances be produced by purely mechanical
processes without design?&rdquo; Kant held the problem to
be insoluble, although Empedocles had pointed out the
direction of the solution two thousand years before.
His principle of &ldquo;teleological mechanism&rdquo; has become
more and more accepted of late years, and has furnished
a mechanical explanation even of the finest and
most recondite processes of organic life by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>&ldquo;the functional
self-production of the purposive structure.&rdquo; Thus
have we got rid of the transcendental &ldquo;design&rdquo; of the
ideological philosophy of the schools, which was the
greatest obstacle to the growth of a rational and monistic
conception of nature.</p>

<p>Very recently, however, this ancient phantom of a
mystic vital force, which seemed to be effectually banished,
has put in a fresh appearance; a number of distinguished
biologists have attempted to reintroduce it
under another name. The clearest presentation of it
is to be found in the <i>Welt als That</i>, of the Kiel botanist,
J. Reinke. He takes upon himself the defence of the
notion of miracle, of theism, of the Mosaic story of
creation, and of the constancy of species; he calls
&ldquo;vital forces,&rdquo; in opposition to physical forces, the directive
or dominant forces. Other neovitalists prefer,
in the good old anthropomorphic style, a &ldquo;supreme&rdquo;
engineer, who has endowed organic substance with a
purposive structure, directed to the realization of a
definite plan. These curious teleological hypotheses,
and the objections to Darwinism which generally accompany
them, do not call for serious scientific refutation
to-day.</p>

<p>Thirty-three years ago I gave the title of &ldquo;dysteleology&rdquo;
to the science of those extremely interesting
and significant biological facts, which, in the most
striking fashion, give a direct contradiction to the teleological
idea &ldquo;of the purposive arrangement of the living
organism.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> This &ldquo;science of rudimentary, abortive,
arrested, distorted, atrophied, and cataplastic individuals&rdquo;
is based on an immense quantity of remarkable
phenomena, which were long familiar to zoologists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
and botanists, but were not properly interpreted, and
their great philosophic significance appreciated, until
Darwin.</p>

<p>All the higher animals and plants, or, in general,
all organisms which are not entirely simple in structure,
but are made up of a number of organs in orderly co-operation,
are found, on close examination, to possess
a number of useless or inoperative members, sometimes,
indeed, hurtful and dangerous. In the flowers of most
plants we find, besides the actual sex-leaves that effect
reproduction, a number of other leaf-organs which have
no use or meaning (arrested or &ldquo;miscarried&rdquo; pistils,
fruit, corona, and calix-leaves, etc.). In the two large
and variegated classes of flying animals, birds and
insects, there are, besides the forms which make constant
use of their wings, a number of species which
have undeveloped wings and cannot fly. In nearly
every class of the higher animals which have eyes there
are certain types that live in the dark; they have eyes,
as a rule, but undeveloped and useless for vision. In
our own human organism we have similar useless
rudimentary structures in the muscles of the ear, in
the eye-lid, in the nipple and milk-gland of the male,
and in other parts of the body; indeed, the vermiform
appendix of our cæcum is not only useless, but extremely
dangerous, and inflammation of it is responsible
for a number of deaths every year.</p>

<p>Neither the old mystic vitalism nor the new, equally
irrational, neovitalism can give any explanation of
these and many other purposeless contrivances in the
structure of the plant and the animal; but they are very
simple in the light of the theory of descent. It shows
that these rudimentary organs are atrophied, owing
to disuse. Just as our muscles, nerves, and organs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
of sense are strengthened by exercise and frequent use,
so, on the other hand, they are liable to degenerate more
or less by disuse or suspended exercise. But, although
the development of the organs is promoted by exercise
and adaptation, they by no means disappear without
leaving a trace after neglect; the force of heredity
retains them for many generations, and only permits
their gradual disappearance after the lapse of a
considerable time. The blind &ldquo;struggle for existence
between the organs&rdquo; determines their historical disappearance,
just as it effected their first origin and development.
There is no internal &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; whatever
in the drama.</p>

<p>The life of the animal and the plant bears the same
universal character of incompleteness as the life of
man. This is directly attributable to the circumstance
that nature&mdash;organic as well as inorganic&mdash;is in a perennial
state of evolution, change, and transformation.
This evolution seems on the whole&mdash;at least as far as
we can survey the development of organic life on our
planet&mdash;to be a progressive improvement, an historical
advance from the simple to the complex, the lower to
the higher, the imperfect to the perfect. I have proved
in my <i>General Morphology</i> that this historical progress&mdash;or
gradual perfecting (<i>teleosis</i>)&mdash;is the inevitable result
of selection, and not the outcome of a preconceived
design. That is clear from the fact that no organism
is perfect; even if it does perfectly adapt itself to its
environment at a given moment, this condition would
not last very long; the conditions of existence of the
environment are themselves subject to perpetual change
and they thus necessitate a continuous adaptation on
the part of the organism.</p>

<p>Under the title of <i>Design in the Living Organism</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
the famous embryologist, Karl Ernst Baer, published
a work in 1876 which, together with the article on Darwinism
which accompanied it, proved very acceptable
to our opponents, and is still much quoted in opposition
to evolution. It was a revival of the old teleological
system under a new name, and we must devote a line
of criticism to it. We must premise that, though Baer
was a scientist of the highest order, his original monistic
views were gradually marred by a tinge of mysticism
with the advance of age, and he eventually became
a thorough dualist. In his profound work on
&ldquo;the evolution of animals&rdquo; (1828), which he himself
entitled <i>Observation and Experiment</i>, these two methods
of investigation are equally applied. By careful observation
of the various phenomena of the development
of the animal ovum Baer succeeded in giving the first
consistent presentation of the remarkable changes which
take place in the growth of the vertebrate from a simple
egg-cell. At the same time he endeavored, by far-seeing
comparison and keen reflection, to learn the causes
of the transformation, and to reduce them to general
constructive laws. He expressed the general result of
his research in the following thesis: &ldquo;The evolution of
the individual is the story of the growth of individuality
in every respect.&rdquo; He meant that &ldquo;the one great
thought that controls all the different aspects of animal
evolution is the same that gathered the scattered
fragments of space into spheres and linked them into
solar systems. This thought is no other than life itself,
and the words and syllables in which it finds
utterance are the varied forms of living things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Baer, however, did not attain to a deeper knowledge
of this great genetic truth and a clearer insight into
the real efficient causes of organic evolution, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
his attention was exclusively given to one half of evolutionary
science, the science of the evolution of the
individual, embryology, or, in a wider sense, <i>ontogeny</i>.
The other half, the science of the evolution of species,
<i>phylogeny</i>, was not yet in existence, although Lamarck
had already pointed out the way to it in 1809. When
it was established by Darwin in 1859, the aged Baer
was no longer in a position to appreciate it; the fruitless
struggle which he led against the theory of selection
clearly proved that he understood neither its real
meaning nor its philosophic importance. Teleological
and, subsequently, theological speculations had incapacitated
the ageing scientist from appreciating this
greatest reform of biology. The teleological observations
which he published against it in his <i>Species and
Studies</i> in his eighty-fourth year are mere repetitions
of errors which the teleology of the dualists has opposed
to the mechanical or monistic system for more than
two thousand years. The &ldquo;telic idea&rdquo; which, according
to Baer, controls the entire evolution of the animal
from the ovum, is only another expression for the
eternal &ldquo;idea&rdquo; of Plato and the <i>entelecheia</i> of his pupil
Aristotle.</p>

<p>Our modern biogeny gives a purely physiological explanation
of the facts of embryology, in assigning the
functions of heredity and adaptation as their causes.
The great biogenetic law, which Baer failed to appreciate,
reveals the intimate causal connection between
the <i>ontogenesis</i> of the individual and the <i>phylogenesis</i>
of its ancestors; the former seems to be a recapitulation
of the latter. Nowhere, however, in the evolution
of animals and plants do we find any trace of design,
but merely the inevitable outcome of the struggle for
existence, the blind controller, instead of the provident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
God, that effects the changes of organic forms by a mutual
action of the laws of heredity and adaptation. And
there is no more trace of &ldquo;design&rdquo; in the embryology
of the individual plant, animal, or man. This <i>ontogeny</i>
is but a brief epitome of <i>phylogeny</i>, an abbreviated and
condensed recapitulation of it, determined by the physiological
laws of heredity.</p>

<p>Baer ended the preface to his classical <i>Evolution of
Animals</i> (1828) with these words: &ldquo;The palm will be
awarded to the fortunate scientist who succeeds in reducing
the constructive forces of the animal body to
the general forces or life-processes of the entire world.
The tree has not yet been planted which is to make his
cradle.&rdquo; The great embryologist erred once more.
That very year, 1828, witnessed the arrival of Charles
Darwin at Cambridge University (for the purpose of
studying theology!)&mdash;the &ldquo;fortunate scientist&rdquo; who
richly earned the palm thirty years afterwards by his
theory of selection.</p>

<p>In the philosophy of history&mdash;that is, in the general
reflections which historians make on the destinies of
nations and the complicated course of political evolution&mdash;there
still prevails the notion of a &ldquo;moral order
of the universe.&rdquo; Historians seek in the vivid drama
of history a leading design, an ideal purpose, which
has ordained one or other race or state to a special triumph,
and to dominion over the others. This teleological
view of history has recently become more strongly
contrasted with our monistic view in proportion as
monism has proved to be the only possible interpretation
of inorganic nature. Throughout the whole of
astronomy, geology, physics, and chemistry there is no
question to-day of a &ldquo;moral order,&rdquo; or a personal God,
whose <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>&ldquo;hand hath disposed all things in wisdom and
understanding.&rdquo; And the same must be said of the
entire field of biology, the whole constitution and history
of organic nature, if we set aside the question of
man for the moment. Darwin has not only proved by
his theory of selection that the orderly processes in the
life and structure of animals and plants have arisen
by mechanical laws without any preconceived design,
but he has shown us in the &ldquo;struggle for life&rdquo; the powerful
natural force which has exerted supreme control
over the entire course of organic evolution for millions
of years. It may be said that the struggle for life
is the &ldquo;survival of the fittest&rdquo; or the &ldquo;victory of the
best&rdquo;; that is only correct when we regard the strongest
as the best (in a moral sense). Moreover, the
whole history of the organic world goes to prove
that, besides the predominant advance towards perfection,
there are at all times cases of retrogression to
lower stages. Even Baer&rsquo;s notion of &ldquo;design&rdquo; has no
moral feature whatever.</p>

<p>Do we find a different state of things in the history
of peoples, which man, in his anthropocentric presumption,
loves to call &ldquo;the history of the world&rdquo;? Do we
find in every phase of it a lofty moral principle or a wise
ruler, guiding the destinies of nations? There can be
but one answer in the present advanced stage of natural
and human history: No. The fate of those branches
of the human family, those nations and races which
have struggled for existence and progress for thousands
of years, is determined by the same &ldquo;eternal
laws of iron&rdquo; as the history of the whole organic world
which has peopled the earth for millions of years.</p>

<p>Geologists distinguish three great epochs in the organic
history of the earth, as far as we can read it in
the monuments of the science of fossils&mdash;the primary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
secondary, and tertiary epochs. According to a recent
calculation, the first occupied at least thirty-four million,
the second eleven million, and the third three
million years. The history of the family of vertebrates,
from which our own race has sprung, unfolds clearly
before our eyes during this long period. Three different
stages in the evolution of the vertebrate correspond
to the three epochs; the <i>fishes</i> characterized the primary
(palæozoic) age, the <i>reptiles</i> the secondary (mesozoic),
and the <i>mammals</i> the tertiary (cænozoic). Of the
three groups the fishes rank lowest in organization,
the reptiles come next, and the mammals take the
highest place. We find, on nearer examination of the
history of the three classes, that their various orders
and families also advanced progressively during the
three epochs towards a higher stage of perfection.
May we consider this progressive development as the
outcome of a conscious design or a moral order of
the universe? Certainly not. The theory of selection
teaches us that this organic progress, like the earlier
organic differentiation, is an inevitable consequence of
the struggle for existence. Thousands of beautiful and
remarkable species of animals and plants have perished
during those forty-eight million years, to give
place to stronger competitors, and the victors in this
struggle for life were not always the noblest or most
perfect forms in a moral sense.</p>

<p>It has been just the same with the history of humanity.
The splendid civilization of classical antiquity
perished because Christianity, with its faith in a loving
God and its hope of a better life beyond the grave, gave
a fresh, strong impetus to the soaring human mind.
The Papal Church quickly degenerated into a pitiful
caricature of real Christianity, and ruthlessly scattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
the treasures of knowledge which the Hellenic philosophy
had gathered; it gained the dominion of the world
through the ignorance of the credulous masses. In
time the Reformation broke the chains of this mental
slavery, and assisted reason to secure its right once
more. But in the new, as in the older, period the great
struggle for existence went on in its eternal fluctuation,
with no trace of a moral order.</p>

<p>And it is just as impossible for the impartial and critical
observer to detect a &ldquo;wise providence&rdquo; in the fate
of individual human beings as a moral order in the history
of peoples. Both are determined with iron necessity
by a mechanical causality which connects every
single phenomenon with one or more antecedent causes.
Even the ancient Greeks recognized <i>ananke</i>, the blind
<i>heimarmene</i>, the fate &ldquo;that rules gods and men,&rdquo; as
the supreme principle of the universe. Christianity replaced
it by a conscious Providence, which is not blind,
but sees, and which governs the world in patriarchal
fashion. The anthropomorphic character of this notion,
generally closely connected with belief in a personal
God, is quite obvious. Belief in a &ldquo;loving Father,&rdquo;
who unceasingly guides the destinies of one billion
five hundred million men on our planet, and is
attentive at all times to their millions of contradictory
prayers and pious wishes, is absolutely impossible;
that is at once perceived on laying aside the colored
spectacles of &ldquo;faith&rdquo; and reflecting rationally on the
subject.</p>

<p>As a rule, this belief in Providence and the tutelage
of a &ldquo;loving Father&rdquo; is more intense in the modern
civilized man&mdash;just as in the uncultured savage&mdash;when
some good fortune has fallen him: an escape from
peril of life, recovery from a severe illness, the winning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
of the first prize in a lottery, the birth of a long-delayed
child, and so forth. When, on the other hand, a misfortune
is met with, or an ardent wish is not fulfilled,
&ldquo;Providence&rdquo; is forgotten. The wise ruler of the
world slumbered&mdash;or refused his blessing.</p>

<p>In the extraordinary development of commerce of the
nineteenth century the number of catastrophes and
accidents has necessarily increased beyond all imagination;
of that the journal is a daily witness. Thousands
are killed every year by shipwreck, railway
accidents, mine accidents, etc. Thousands slay each
other every year in war, and the preparation for this
wholesale massacre absorbs much the greater part of
the revenue in the highest civilized nations, the chief
professors of &ldquo;Christian charity.&rdquo; And among these
hundreds of thousands of annual victims of modern
civilization strong, industrious, courageous workers
predominate. Yet the talk of a &ldquo;moral order&rdquo; goes on.</p>

<p>Since impartial study of the evolution of the world
teaches us that there is no definite aim and no special
purpose to be traced in it, there seems to be no alternative
but to leave everything to &ldquo;blind chance.&rdquo; This
reproach has been made to the transformism of Lamarck
and Darwin, as it had been to the previous
systems of Kant and Laplace; there are a number of
dualist philosophers who lay great stress on it. It is,
therefore, worth while to make a brief remark upon it.</p>

<p>One group of philosophers affirms, in accordance
with its teleological conception, that the whole cosmos
is an orderly system, in which every phenomenon has
its aim and purpose; there is no such thing as chance.
The other group, holding a mechanical theory, expresses
itself thus: The development of the universe
is a monistic mechanical process, in which we discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
no aim or purpose whatever; what we call design in
the organic world is a special result of biological agencies;
neither in the evolution of the heavenly bodies
nor in that of the crust of our earth do we find any trace
of a controlling purpose&mdash;all is the result of chance.
Each party is right&mdash;according to its definition of
chance. The general law of causality, taken in conjunction
with the law of substance, teaches us that
every phenomenon has a mechanical cause; in this
sense there is no such thing as chance. Yet it is not
only lawful, but necessary, to retain the term for the
purpose of expressing the simultaneous occurrence of
two phenomena, which are not causally related to each
other, but of which each has its own mechanical cause,
independent of that of the other. Everybody knows
that chance, in its monistic sense, plays an important
part in the life of man and in the universe at large.
That, however, does not prevent us from recognizing
in each &ldquo;chance&rdquo; event, as we do in the evolution of
the entire cosmos, the universal sovereignty of nature&rsquo;s
supreme law, <i>the law of substance</i>.</p>

<p>For thousands of years humanity has placed the
last and supreme basis of all phenomena in an
efficient cause, to which it gives the title of God (<i>deus</i>,
<i>theos</i>). Like all general ideas, this notion of God has
undergone a series of remarkable modifications and
transformations in the course of the evolution of reason.
Indeed, it may be said that no other idea has had
so many metamorphoses; for no other belief affects in
so high a degree the chief objects of the mind and of
rational science, as well as the deepest interests of the
emotion and poetic fancy of the believer.</p>

<p>A comparative criticism of the many different forms
of the idea of God would be extremely interesting and
instructive; but we have not space for it in the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
work. We must be content with a passing glance at
the most important forms of the belief and their relation
to the modern thought that has been evoked by a
sound study of nature. For further information on
this interesting question the reader would do well to
consult the distinguished work of Adalbert Svoboda,
<i>Forms of Faith</i> (1897).</p>

<p>When we pass over the finer shades and the variegated
clothing of the God-idea and confine our attention
to its chief element, we can distribute all the different
presentations of it in two groups&mdash;the <i>theistic</i>
and <i>pantheistic</i> group. The latter is closely connected
with the monistic, or rational, view of things, and the
former is associated with dualism and mysticism.</p>

<h3>I.&mdash;THEISM</h3>

<p>In this view God is distinct from, and opposed to, the
world as its creator, sustainer, and ruler. He is always
conceived in a more or less human form, as an
organism which thinks and acts like a man&mdash;only on
a much higher scale. This anthropomorphic God,
polyphyletically evolved by the different races, assumes
an infinity of shapes in their imagination, from
fetichism to the refined monotheistic religions of the
present day. The chief forms of theism are polytheism,
triplotheism, amphitheism, and monotheism.</p>

<p>The polytheist peoples the world with a variety of
gods and goddesses, which enter into its machinery
more or less independently. <i>Fetichism</i> sees such subordinate
deities in the lifeless body of nature, in rocks,
in water, in the air, in human productions of every
kind (pictures, statues, etc.). <i>Demonism</i> sees gods in
living organisms of every species&mdash;trees, animals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
men. This kind of polytheism is found in innumerable
forms even in the lowest tribes. It reaches the
highest stage in Hellenic polytheism, in the myths of
ancient Greece, which still furnish the finest images to
the modern poet and artist. At a much lower stage
we have Catholic polytheism, in which innumerable
&ldquo;saints&rdquo; (many of them of very equivocal repute) are
venerated as subordinate divinities, and prayed to to
exert their mediation with the supreme divinity.</p>

<p>The dogma of the &ldquo;Trinity,&rdquo; which still comprises
three of the chief articles of faith in the creed of Christian
peoples, culminates in the notion that the one God
of Christianity is really made up of <i>three</i> different persons:
(1) God the Father, the omnipotent creator of heaven
and earth (this untenable myth was refuted long
ago by scientific cosmogony, astronomy, and geology);
(2) Jesus Christ; and (3) the Holy Ghost, a mystical
being, over whose incomprehensible relation to the
Father and the Son millions of Christian theologians
have racked their brains in vain for the last nineteen
hundred years. The Gospels, which are the only
clear sources of this <i>triplotheism</i>, are very obscure as
to the relation of these three persons to each other, and
do not give a satisfactory answer to the question of
their unity. On the other hand, it must be carefully
noted what confusion this obscure and mystic dogma
of the Trinity must necessarily cause in the minds of
our children even in the earlier years of instruction.
One morning they learn (in their religious instruction)
that three times one are one, and the very next hour
they are told in their arithmetic class that three times
one are three. I remember well the reflection that this
confusion led me to in my early school-days.</p>

<p>For the rest, the &ldquo;Trinity&rdquo; is not an original ele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>ment
in Christianity; like most of the other Christian
dogmas, it has been borrowed from earlier religions.
Out of the sun-worship of the Chaldean magi was
evolved the Trinity of Ilu, the mysterious source of the
world; its three manifestations were Anu, primeval
chaos; Bel, the architect of the world; and Aa, the
heavenly light, the all-enlightening wisdom. In the
Brahmanic religion the Trimurti is also conceived as
a &ldquo;divine unity&rdquo; made up of three persons&mdash;Brahma
(the creator), Vishnu (the sustainer), and Shiva (the
destroyer). It would seem that in this and other ideas
of a Trinity the &ldquo;sacred number, three,&rdquo; as such&mdash;as
a &ldquo;symbolical number&rdquo;&mdash;has counted for something.
The three first Christian virtues&mdash;Faith, Hope, and
Charity&mdash;form a similar <i>triad</i>.</p>

<p>According to the <i>amphitheists</i>, the world is ruled by
two different gods, a good and an evil principle, God
and the Devil. They are engaged in a perpetual struggle,
like rival emperors, or pope and anti-pope. The
condition of the world is the result of this conflict. The
loving God, or good principle, is the source of all that
is good and beautiful, of joy and of peace. The world
would be perfect if His work were not continually
thwarted by the evil principle, the Devil; this being
is the cause of all that is bad and hateful, of contradiction
and of pain.</p>

<p>Amphitheism is undoubtedly the most rational of
all forms of belief in God, and the one which is least
incompatible with a scientific view of the world. Hence
we find it elaborated in many ancient peoples thousands
of years before Christ. In ancient India Vishnu,
the preserver, struggles with Shiva, the destroyer. In
ancient Egypt the good Osiris is opposed by the wicked
Typhon. The early Hebrews had a similar dualism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
of Aschera (or Keturah), the fertile mother-earth, and
Elion (Moloch or Sethos), the stern heavenly father.
In the Zend religion of the ancient Persians, founded
by Zoroaster two thousand years before Christ, there
is a perpetual struggle between Ormuzd, the good god
of light, and Ahriman, the wicked god of darkness.</p>

<p>In Christian mythology the Devil is scarcely less
conspicuous as the adversary of the good deity, the
tempter and seducer, the prince of hell, and lord of
darkness. A personal devil was still an important
element in the belief of most Christians at the beginning
of the nineteenth century. Towards the middle
of the century he was gradually eliminated by being
progressively explained away, or he was restricted to
the subordinate <i>rôle</i> he plays as Mephistopheles in
Goethe&rsquo;s great drama. To-day the majority of educated
people look upon &ldquo;belief in a personal devil&rdquo; as
a mediæval superstition, while &ldquo;belief in God&rdquo; (that
is, the personal, good, and loving God) is retained as
an indispensable element of religion. Yet the one belief
is just as much (or as little) justified as the other.
In any case, the much-lamented &ldquo;imperfection of our
earthly life,&rdquo; the &ldquo;struggle for existence,&rdquo; and all that
pertains to it, are explained much more simply and
naturally by this struggle of a good and an evil god
than by any other form of theism.</p>

<p>The dogma of the unity of God may in some respects
be regarded as the simplest and most natural
type of theism; it is popularly supposed to be the
most widely accepted element of religion, and to predominate
in the ecclesiastical systems of civilized countries.
In reality, that is not the case, because this alleged
&ldquo;monotheism&rdquo; usually turns out on closer inquiry
to be one of the other forms of theism we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
examined, a number of subordinate deities being generally
introduced besides the supreme one. Most of
the religions which took a purely monotheistic stand-point
have become more or less polytheistic in the
course of time. Modern statistics assure us that of
the one billion five hundred million men who people
the earth the great majority are monotheists; of these,
<i>nominally</i>, about six hundred millions are Brahma-Buddhists,
five hundred millions are called Christians,
two hundred millions are heathens (of various types),
one hundred and eighty millions are Mohammedans,
ten millions are Jews, and ten millions have no religion
at all. However, the vast majority of these
nominal monotheists have very confused ideas about
the deity, or believe in a number of gods and goddesses
besides the chief god&mdash;angels, devils, etc.</p>

<p>The different forms which monotheism has assumed
in the course of its polyphyletic development may be
distributed in two groups&mdash;those of <i>naturalistic</i> and
<i>anthropistic</i> monotheism. Naturalistic monotheism
finds the embodiment of the deity in some lofty and
dominating natural phenomenon. The sun, the deity
of light and warmth, on whose influence all organic
life insensibly and directly depends, was taken to be
such a phenomenon many thousand years ago. Sun-worship
(solarism, or heliotheism) seems to the modern
scientist to be the best of all forms of theism, and the
one which may be most easily reconciled with modern
monism. For modern astrophysics and geogeny have
taught us that the earth is a fragment detached from
the sun, and that it will eventually return to the bosom
of its parent. Modern physiology teaches us that the
first source of organic life on the earth is the formation
of protoplasm, and that this synthesis of simple inor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>ganic
substances, water, carbonic acid, and ammonia,
only takes place under the influence of sunlight. On
the primary evolution of the plasmodomous plants followed,
secondarily, that of the plasmophagous animals,
which directly or indirectly depend on them for nourishment;
and the origin of the human race itself is
only a later stage in the development of the animal
kingdom. Indeed, the whole of our bodily and mental
life depends, in the last resort, like all other organic
life, on the light and heat rays of the sun. Hence in
the light of pure reason, sun-worship, as a form of naturalistic
monotheism, seems to have a much better
foundation than the anthropistic worship of Christians
and of other monotheists who conceive their god in
human form. As a matter of fact, the sun-worshippers
attained, thousands of years ago, a higher intellectual
and moral standard than most of the other theists.
When I was in Bombay, in 1881, I watched with the
greatest sympathy the elevating rites of the pious
Parsees, who, standing on the sea-shore, or kneeling
on their prayer-rugs, offered their devotion to the sun
at its rise and setting.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Moon-worship (lunarism and selenotheism) is of
much less importance than sun-worship. There are
a few uncivilized races that have adored the moon as
their only deity, but it has generally been associated
with a worship of the stars and the sun.</p>

<p>The humanization of God, or the idea that the &ldquo;Supreme
Being&rdquo; feels, thinks, and acts like man (though
in a higher degree), has played a most important part,
as <i>anthropomorphic monotheism</i>, in the history of civilization.
The most prominent in this respect are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
three great religions of the Mediterranean peoples&mdash;the
old Mosaic religion, the intermediate Christian
religion, and the younger Mohammedanism. These
three great Mediterranean religions, all three arising
on the east coast of the most interesting of all seas, and
originating in an imaginative enthusiast of the Semitic
race, are intimately connected, not only by this
external circumstance of an analogous origin, but
by many common features of their internal contents.
Just as Christianity borrowed a good deal of its mythology
directly from ancient Judaism, so Islam has
inherited much from both its predecessors. All the
three were originally monotheistic; all three were subsequently
overlaid with a great variety of polytheistic
features, in proportion as they extended, first along
the coast of the Mediterranean with its heterogeneous
population, and eventually into every part of the world.</p>

<p>The Hebrew monotheism, as it was founded by Moses
(about 1600 <span class="small">B.C.</span>), is usually regarded as the ancient
faith which has been of the greatest importance in the
ethical and religious development of humanity. This
high historical appreciation is certainly valid in the
sense that the two other world-conquering Mediterranean
religions issued from it; Christ was just as truly
a pupil of Moses as Mohammed was afterwards of Christ.
So also the New Testament, which has become the
foundation of the belief of the highest civilized nations
in the short space of nineteen hundred years, rests on
the venerable basis of the Old Testament. The Bible,
which the two compose, has had a greater influence and
a wider circulation than any other book in the world.
Even to-day the Bible&mdash;in spite of its curious mingling
of the best and the worst elements&mdash;is in a certain sense
the &ldquo;book of books.&rdquo; Yet when we make an impar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>tial
and unprejudiced study of this notable historical
source, we find it very different in several important
respects from the popular impression. Here again
modern criticism and history have come to certain conclusions
which destroy the prevalent tradition in its
very foundations.</p>

<p>The monotheism which Moses endeavored to establish
in the worship of Jehovah, and which the prophets&mdash;the
philosophers of the Hebrew race&mdash;afterwards
developed with great success, had at first to sustain
a long and severe struggle with the dominant polytheism
which was in possession. Jehovah, or Yahveh,
was originally derived from the heaven-god, which,
under the title of Moloch or Baal, was one of the most
popular of the Oriental deities (the Sethos or Typhon
of the Egyptians, and the Saturn or Cronos of the
Greeks). There were, however, other gods in great
favor with the Jewish people, and so the struggle with
&ldquo;idolatry&rdquo; continued. Still, Jehovah was, in principle,
the only God, explicitly claiming, in the first precept
of the decalogue: &ldquo;I am the Lord thy God; thou
shalt have no other gods beside me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Christian monotheism shared the fate of its mother,
Mosaism; it was generally only monotheistic in
theory, while it degenerated practically into every
kind of polytheism. In point of fact, monotheism was
logically abandoned in the very dogma of the Trinity,
which was adopted as an indispensable foundation
of the Christian religion. The three persons, which
are distinguished as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are
three distinct individuals (and, indeed, anthropomorphic
persons), just as truly as the three Indian deities
of the Trimurti (Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva) or the
Trinity of the ancient Hebrews (Anu, Bel, and Aa).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Moreover, in the most widely distributed form of Christianity
the &ldquo;virgin&rdquo; mother of Christ plays an important
part as a fourth deity; in many Catholic countries
she is practically taken to be much more powerful and
influential than the three male persons of the celestial
administration. The cult of the madonna has been developed
to such an extent in these countries that we
may oppose it to the usual masculine form of monotheism
as one of a feminine type. The &ldquo;Queen of
Heaven&rdquo; becomes so prominent, as is seen in so many
pictures and legends of the madonna, that the three
male persons practically disappear.</p>

<p>In addition, the imagination of the pious Christian
soon came to increase this celestial administration by
a numerous company of &ldquo;saints&rdquo; of all kinds, and
bands of musical angels, who should see that &ldquo;eternal
life&rdquo; should not prove too dull. The popes&mdash;the greatest
charlatans that any religion ever produced&mdash;have
constantly studied to increase this band of celestial
satellites by repeated canonizations. This curious company
received its most interesting acquisition in 1870,
when the Vatican Council pronounced the popes, as
the vicars of Christ, to be infallible, and thus raised
them to a divine dignity. When we add the &ldquo;personal
Devil&rdquo; that they acknowledge, and the &ldquo;bad angels&rdquo;
who form his court, we have in modern Catholicism,
still the most extensive branch of Christianity, a rich
and variegated polytheism that dwarfs the Olympic
family of the Greeks.</p>

<p>Islam, or the Mohammedan monotheism, is the
youngest and purest form of monotheism. When the
young Mohammed (born 570) learned to despise the
polytheistic idolatry of his Arabian compatriots, and
became acquainted with Nestorian Christianity, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
adopted its chief doctrines in a general way; but he
could not bring himself to see anything more than a
prophet in Christ, like Moses. He found in the dogma
of the Trinity what every emancipated thinker finds
on impartial reflection&mdash;an absurd legend which is
neither reconcilable with the first principles of reason
nor of any value whatever for our religious advancement.
He justly regarded the worship of the immaculate
mother of God as a piece of pure idolatry, like the
veneration of pictures and images. The longer he reflected
on it, and the more he strove after a purified
idea of deity, the clearer did the certitude of his great
maxim appear: &ldquo;God is the only God&rdquo;&mdash;there are no
other gods beside him.</p>

<p>Yet Mohammed could not free himself from the anthropomorphism
of the God-idea. His one only God
was an idealized, almighty man, like the stern, vindictive
God of Moses, and the gentle, loving God of
Christ. Still, we must admit that the Mohammedan
religion has preserved the character of pure monotheism
throughout the course of its historical development
and its inevitable division much more faithfully than
the Mosaic and Christian religions. We see that to-day,
even externally, in its forms of prayer and preaching,
and in the architecture and adornment of its
mosques. When I visited the East for the first time, in
1873, and admired the noble mosques of Cairo, Smyrna,
Brussa, and Constantinople, I was inspired with a feeling
of real devotion by the simple and tasteful decoration
of the interior, and the lofty and beautiful architectural
work of the exterior. How noble and inspiring
do these mosques appear in comparison with the
majority of Catholic churches, which are covered internally
with gaudy pictures and gilt, and are out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>wardly
disfigured by an immoderate crowd of human
and animal figures! Not less elevated are the silent
prayers and the simple devotional acts of the Koran
when compared with the loud, unintelligible verbosity
of the Catholic Mass and the blatant music of their
theatrical processions.</p>

<p>Under the title of <i>mixotheism</i> we may embrace all the
forms of theistic belief which contain mixtures of religious
notions of different, sometimes contradictory,
kinds. In theory this most widely diffused type of
religion is not recognized at all; in the concrete it is
the most important and most notable of all. The vast
majority of men who have religious opinions have always
been, and still are, <i>mixotheists</i>; their idea of God
is picturesquely compounded from the impressions received
in childhood from their own sect, and a number
of other impressions which are received later on, from
contact with members of other religions, and which
modify the earlier notions. In educated people there is
also sometimes the modifying influence of philosophic
studies in maturer years, and especially the unprejudiced
study of natural phenomena, which reveals the
futility of the theistic idea. The conflict of these contradictory
impressions, which is very painful to a sensitive
soul, and which often remains undecided throughout
life, clearly shows the immense power of the <i>heredity</i>
of ancient myths on the one hand and the early
<i>adaptation</i> to erroneous dogmas on the other. The
particular faith in which the child has been brought
up generally remains in power, unless a &ldquo;conversion&rdquo;
takes place subsequently, owing to the stronger influence
of some other religion. But even in this supersession
of one faith by another the new name, like the old
one, proves to be merely an outward label covering a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
mixture of the most diverse opinions and errors. The
greater part of those who call themselves Christians
are not monotheists (as they think), but amphitheists,
triplotheists, or polytheists. And the same must be
said of Islam and Mosaism, and other monotheistic
religions. Everywhere we find associated with the
original idea of a &ldquo;sole and triune God&rdquo; later beliefs
in a number of subordinate deities&mdash;angels, devils,
saints, etc.&mdash;a picturesque assortment of the most diverse
theistic forms.</p>

<p>All the above forms of theism, in the proper sense of
the word&mdash;whether the belief assumes a naturalistic or
an anthropistic form&mdash;represent God to be an extramundane
or a supernatural being. He is always opposed
to the world, or nature, as an independent being;
generally as its creator, sustainer, and ruler. In most
religions he has the additional character of personality,
or, to put it more definitely still, God as a person is
likened to man. &ldquo;In his gods man paints himself.&rdquo;
This anthropomorphic conception of God as one
who thinks, feels, and acts like man prevails with the
great majority of theists, sometimes in a cruder and
more naïve form, sometimes in a more refined and
abstract degree. In any case the form of theosophy
we have described is sure to affirm that God, the supreme
being, is infinite in perfection, and therefore far
removed from the imperfection of humanity. Yet,
when we examine closely, we always find the same
psychic or mental activity in the two. God feels,
thinks, and acts as man does, although it be in an
infinitely more perfect form.</p>

<p>The <i>personal anthropism</i> of God has become so natural
to the majority of believers that they experience
no shock when they find God personified in human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
form in pictures and statues, and in the varied images
of the poet, in which God takes human form&mdash;that is,
is changed into a vertebrate. In some myths, even,
God takes the form of other mammals (an ape, lion,
bull, etc.), and more rarely of a bird (eagle, dove, or
stork), or of some lower vertebrate (serpent, crocodile,
dragon, etc.).</p>

<p>In the higher and more abstract forms of religion
this idea of bodily appearance is entirely abandoned,
and God is adored as a &ldquo;pure spirit&rdquo; without a body.
&ldquo;God is a spirit, and they who worship him must
worship him in spirit and in truth.&rdquo; Nevertheless,
the psychic activity of this &ldquo;pure spirit&rdquo; remains just
the same as that of the anthropomorphic God. In reality,
even this immaterial spirit is not conceived to be
incorporeal, but merely invisible, gaseous. We thus
arrive at the paradoxical conception of God as a <i>gaseous
vertebrate</i>.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;PANTHEISM</h3>

<p>Pantheism teaches that God and the world are one.
The idea of God is identical with that of nature or substance.
This pantheistic view is sharply opposed in
principle to all the systems we have described, and to
all possible forms of theism although there have been
many attempts made from both sides to bridge over
the deep chasm that separates the two. There is always
this fundamental contradiction between them,
that in theism God is opposed to nature as an <i>extramundane</i>
being, as creating and sustaining the world, and
acting upon it from without, while in pantheism God,
as an <i>intramundane</i> being, is everywhere identical
with nature itself, and is operative <i>within</i> the world
as &ldquo;force&rdquo; or &ldquo;energy.&rdquo; The latter view alone is com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>patible
with our supreme law&mdash;the law of substance.
It follows necessarily that pantheism is <i>the world-system
of the modern scientist</i>. There are, it is true,
still a few men of science who contest this, and think
it possible to reconcile the old theistic theory of human
nature with the pantheistic truth of the law of substance.
All these efforts rest on confusion or sophistry&mdash;when
they are honest.</p>

<p>As pantheism is a result of an advanced conception
of nature in the civilized mind, it is naturally much
younger than theism, the crudest forms of which are
found in great variety in the uncivilized races of ten
thousand years ago. We do, indeed, find the germs
of pantheism in different religions at the very dawn of
philosophy in the earliest civilized peoples (in India,
Egypt, China, and Japan), several thousand years before
the time of Christ; still, we do not meet a definite
philosophical expression of it until the hylozoism of
the Ionic philosophers, in the first half of the sixth century
before Christ. All the great thinkers of this flourishing
period of Hellenic thought are surpassed by the
famous Anaximander, of Miletus, who conceived the
essential unity of the infinite universe (<i>apeiron</i>) more
profoundly and more clearly than his master, Thales,
or his pupil, Anaximenes. Not only the great thought
of the original unity of the cosmos and the development
of all phenomena out of the all-pervading primitive
matter found expression in Anaximander, but he even
enunciated the bold idea of countless worlds in a periodic
alternation of birth and death.</p>

<p>Many other great philosophers of classical antiquity,
especially Democritus, Heraclitus, and Empedocles,
had, in the same or an analogous sense, a profound
conception of this unity of nature and God, of body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
and spirit, which has obtained its highest expression
in the law of substance of our modern monism. The
famous Roman poet and philosopher, Lucretius Carus,
has presented it in a highly poetic form in his poem
&ldquo;De Rerum Natura.&rdquo; However, this true pantheistic
monism was soon entirely displaced by the mystic
dualism of Plato, and especially by the powerful influence
which the idealistic philosophy obtained by its
blending with Christian dogmas. When the papacy
attained to its spiritual despotism over the world, pantheism
was hopelessly crushed; Giordano Bruno, its
most gifted defender, was burned alive by the &ldquo;Vicar
of Christ&rdquo; in the Campo dei Fiori at Rome on February
17, 1600.</p>

<p>It was not until the middle of the seventeenth century
that pantheism was exhibited in its purest form by the
great Baruch Spinoza; he gave for the totality of things
a definition of substance in which God and the world
are inseparably united. The clearness, confidence,
and consistency of Spinoza&rsquo;s monistic system are the
more remarkable when we remember that this gifted
thinker of two hundred and fifty years ago was without
the support of all those sound empirical bases which
have been obtained in the second half of the nineteenth
century. We have already spoken, in the first chapter,
of Spinoza&rsquo;s relation to the materialism of the eighteenth
and the monism of the nineteenth century. The
propagation of his views, especially in Germany, is due,
above all, to the immortal works of our greatest poet and
thinker, Wolfgang Goethe. His splendid <i>God and
the World</i>, <i>Prometheus</i>, <i>Faust</i>, etc., embody the great
thoughts of pantheism in the most perfect poetic creations.</p>

<p>Atheism affirms that there are no gods or goddesses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
assuming that god means a personal, extramundane
entity. This &ldquo;godless world-system&rdquo; substantially
agrees with the monism or pantheism of the modern
scientist; it is only another expression for it, emphasizing
its negative aspect, the non-existence of any supernatural
deity. In this sense Schopenhauer justly
remarks: &ldquo;Pantheism is only a polite form of atheism.
The truth of pantheism lies in its destruction of the
dualist antithesis of God and the world, in its recognition
that the world exists in virtue of its own inherent
forces. The maxim of the pantheist, &lsquo;God and
the world are one,&rsquo; is merely a polite way of giving
the Lord God his <i>congé</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the whole of the Middle Ages, under the bloody
despotism of the popes, atheism was persecuted with
fire and sword as a most pernicious system. As the
&ldquo;godless&rdquo; man is plainly identified with the &ldquo;wicked&rdquo;
in the Gospel, and is threatened&mdash;simply on account of
his &ldquo;want of faith&rdquo;&mdash;with the eternal fires of hell, it
was very natural that every good Christian should be
anxious to avoid the suspicion of atheism. Unfortunately,
the idea still prevails very widely. The atheistic
scientist who devotes his strength and his life to the
search for the truth, is freely credited with all that is
evil; the theistic church-goer, who thoughtlessly follows
the empty ceremonies of Catholic worship, is at
once assumed to be a good citizen, even if there be no
meaning whatever in his faith and his morality be deplorable.
This error will only be destroyed when, in
the twentieth century, the prevalent superstition gives
place to rational knowledge and to a monistic conception
of the unity of God and the world.</p>

<p>Every effort of genuine science makes for a knowledge
of the truth. Our only real and valuable
knowledge is a knowledge of nature itself, and consists
of presentations which correspond to external
things. We are incompetent, it is true, to penetrate
into the innermost nature of this real world&mdash;the &ldquo;thing
in itself&rdquo;&mdash;but impartial critical observation and comparison
inform us that, in the normal action of the
brain and the organs of sense, the impressions received
by them from the outer world are the same in all rational
men, and that in the normal function of the
organs of thought certain presentations are formed
which are everywhere the same. These presentations
we call <i>true</i>, and we are convinced that their content
corresponds to the knowable aspect of things.
We <i>know</i> that these facts are not imaginary, but real.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>All knowledge of the truth depends on two different,
but intimately connected, groups of human physiological
functions: firstly, on the <i>sense-impressions</i> of
the object by means of sense-action, and, secondly, on
the combination of these impressions by an association
into <i>presentations</i> in the subject. The instruments
of sensation are the sense-organs (<i>sensilla</i> or
<i>aestheta</i>); the instruments which form and link together
the presentations are the organs of thought
(<i>phroneta</i>). The latter are part of the central, and the
former part of the peripheral, nervous system&mdash;that
important and elaborate system of organs in the higher
animals which alone effects their entire psychic activity.</p>

<p>Man&rsquo;s sense-activity, which is the starting-point of
all knowledge, has been slowly and gradually developed
from that of his nearest mammal relatives, the
primates. The sense-organs are of substantially the
same construction throughout this highest animal
group, and their function takes place always according
to the same physical and chemical laws. They have
had the same historical development in all cases. In
the mammals, as in the case of all other animals, the
<i>sensilla</i> were originally parts of the skin; the sensitive
cells of the epidermis are the sources of all the different
sense-organs, which have acquired their specific
energy by adaptation to different stimuli (light, heat,
sound, chemical action, etc.). The rod-cells in the retina
of the eye, the auditory cells in the cochlea of the
ear, the olfactory cells in the nose, and the taste-cells
on the tongue, are all originally derived from the simple,
indifferent cells of the epidermis, which cover the
entire surface of the body. This significant fact can
be directly proved by observation of the embryonic development
of man or any of the higher animals. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
from this ontogenetic fact we confidently infer, in virtue
of the great biogenetic law, the important phylogenetic
proposition, that in the long historical evolution of our
ancestors, likewise, the higher sense-organs with their
specific energies were originally derived from the epidermis
of lower animals, from a simple layer of cells
which had no trace of such differentiated sensilla.</p>

<p>A particular importance attaches to the circumstance
that different nerves are qualified to perceive different
properties of the environment, and these only. The
optic nerve accomplishes only the perception of light,
the auditory nerve the perception of sound, the olfactory
nerve the perception of smell, and so on. No matter
what stimuli impinge on and irritate a given sense-organ,
its reaction is always of the same character.
From this specific energy of the sense-nerves, which
was first fully appreciated by Johannes Müller, very
erroneous inferences have been drawn, especially in
favor of a dualistic and <i>à priori</i> theory of knowledge.
It has been affirmed that the brain, or the soul, only
perceives a certain condition of the stimulated nerve,
and that, consequently, no conclusion can be drawn
from the process as to the existence and nature of the
stimulating environment. Sceptical philosophy concluded
that the very existence of an outer world is
doubtful, and extreme idealism went on positively to
deny it, contending that things only exist in our impressions
of them.</p>

<p>In opposition to these erroneous views, we must recall
the fact that the &ldquo;specific energy&rdquo; was not originally
an innate, special quality of the various nerves,
but it has arisen by adaptation to the particular activity
of the epidermic cells in which they terminate.
In harmony with the great law of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>&ldquo;division of labor&rdquo;
the originally indifferent &ldquo;sense-cells of the skin&rdquo; undertook
different tasks, one group of them taking over
the stimulus of the light rays, another the impress of
the sound waves, a third the chemical impulse of odorous
substances, and so on. In the course of a very
long period these external stimuli effected a gradual
change in the physiological, and later in the morphological,
properties of these parts of the epidermis, and
there was a correlative modification of the sensitive
nerves which conduct the impressions they receive to
the brain. Selection improved, step by step, such particular
modifications as proved to be useful, and thus
eventually, in the course of many million years, created
those wonderful instruments, the eye and the ear,
which we prize so highly; their structure is so remarkably
purposive that they might well lead to the erroneous
assumption of a &ldquo;creation on a preconceived design.&rdquo;
The peculiar character of each sense-organ and
its specific nerve has thus been gradually evolved by
use and exercise&mdash;that is, by <i>adaptation</i>&mdash;and has then
been transmitted by <i>heredity</i> from generation to generation.
Albrecht Rau has thoroughly established this
view in his excellent work on <i>Sensation and Thought</i>,
a physiological inquiry into the nature of the human
understanding (1896). It points out the correct significance
of Müller&rsquo;s law of specific sense-energies,
adding searching investigations into their relation to
the brain, and in the last chapter there is an able &ldquo;philosophy
of sensitivity&rdquo; based on the ideas of Ludwig
Feuerbach. I thoroughly agree with his convincing
work.</p>

<p>Critical comparison of sense-action in man and the
other vertebrates has brought to light a number of extremely
important facts, the knowledge of which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
owe to the penetrating research of the nineteenth century,
especially of the second half of the century. This
is particularly true of the two most elaborate &ldquo;æsthetic&rdquo;
organs, the eye and the ear. They present a different
and more complicated structure in the vertebrates than
in the other animals, and have also a characteristic
development in the embryo. This typical ontogenesis
and structure of the sensilla of all the vertebrates is
only explained by <i>heredity</i> from a common ancestor.
Within the vertebrate group, however, we find a
great variety of structure in points of detail, and this
is due to <i>adaptation</i> to their manner of life on the part of
the various species, to the increasing or diminishing
use of various parts.</p>

<p>In respect of the structure of his sense-organs man
is by no means the most perfect and most highly-developed
vertebrate. The eye of the eagle is much
keener, and can distinguish small objects at a distance
much more clearly than the human eye. The hearing
of many mammals, especially of the carnivora, ungulata,
and rodentia of the desert, is much more sensitive
than that of man, and perceives slight noises at
a much greater distance; that may be seen at a glance
by their large and very sensitive cochlea. Singing
birds have attained a higher grade of development,
even in respect of musical endowment, than the majority
of men. The sense of smell is much more developed
in most of the mammals, especially in the carnivora
and the ungulata, than in man; if the dog could
compare his own fine scent with that of man, he would
look down on us with compassion. Even with regard
to the lower senses&mdash;taste, sex-sense, touch, and temperature&mdash;man
has by no means reached the highest
stage in every respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>We can naturally only pass judgment on the sensations
which we ourselves experience. However, anatomy
informs us of the presence in the bodies of many
animals of other senses than those we are familiar with.
Thus fishes and other lower aquatic vertebrates have
peculiar sensilla in the skin which are in connection
with special sense-nerves. On the right and left sides
of the fish&rsquo;s body there is a long canal, branching into
a number of smaller canals at the head. In this &ldquo;mucous
canal&rdquo; there are nerves with numerous branches,
the terminations of which are connected with peculiar
nerve-aggregates. This extensive epidermic sense-organ
probably serves for the perception of changes
in the pressure, or in other properties, of the water.
Some groups are distinguished by the possession of
other peculiar sensilla, the meaning of which is still
unknown to us.</p>

<p>But it is already clear from the above facts that our
human sense-activity is limited, not only in quantity,
but in quality also. We can thus only perceive with
our senses, especially with the eye and the sense of
touch, a part of the qualities of the objects in our environment.
And even this partial perception is incomplete,
in the sense that our organs are imperfect,
and our sensory nerves, acting as interpreters, communicate
to the brain only a translation of the impressions
received.</p>

<p>However, this acknowledged imperfection of our
senses should not prevent us from recognizing their
instruments, and especially the eye, to be organs of
the highest type; together with the thought-organs in
the brain, they are nature&rsquo;s most valuable gift to man.
Very truly does Albrecht Rau say: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>&ldquo;All science is
sensitive knowledge in the ultimate analysis; it does
not deny, but interpret, the data of the senses. The
senses are our first and best friends. Long before the
mind is developed the senses tell man what he must do
and avoid. He who makes a general disavowal of the
senses in order to meet their dangers acts as thoughtlessly
and as foolishly as the man who plucks out his
eyes because they once fell on shameful things, or the
man who cuts off his hand lest at any time it should
reach out to the goods of his neighbor.&rdquo; Hence Feuerbach
is quite right in calling all philosophies, religions,
and systems which oppose the principle of sense-action
not only erroneous, but really pernicious. Without the
senses there is no knowledge&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Nihil est in intellectu,
quod non fuerit in sensu</i>,&rdquo; as Locke said. Twenty years
ago I pointed out, in my chapter &ldquo;On the Origin and
Development of the Sense-Organs,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> the great service
of Darwinism in giving us a profounder knowledge
and a juster appreciation of the senses.</p>

<p>The thirst for knowledge of the educated mind is
not contented with the defective acquaintance with the
outer world which is obtained through our imperfect
sense-organs. He endeavors to build up the sense-impressions
which they have brought him into valuable
knowledge. He transforms them into specific sense-perceptions
in the sense-centres of the cortex of the
brain, and combines them into presentations, by association,
in the thought-centres. Finally, by a further
concatenation of the groups of presentations he attains
to connected knowledge. But this knowledge remains
defective and unsatisfactory until the imagination
supplements the inadequate power of combination
of the intelligence, and, by the association of stored-up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
images, unites the isolated elements into a connected
whole. Thus are produced new general presentative
images, and these suffice to interpret the facts perceived
and satisfy &ldquo;reason&rsquo;s feeling of causality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The presentations which fill up the gaps in our
knowledge, or take its place, may be called, in a broad
sense, &ldquo;faith.&rdquo; That is what happens continually in
daily life. When we are not sure about a thing we
say, I believe it. In this sense we are compelled to
make use of faith even in science itself; we conjecture
or assume that a certain relation exists between two
phenomena, though we do not know it for certain. If it
is a question of a <i>cause</i>, we form a <i>hypothesis</i>; though
in science only such hypotheses are admitted as lie
within the sphere of human cognizance, and do not
contradict known facts. Such hypotheses are, for instance&mdash;in
physics the theory of the vibratory movement
of ether, in chemistry the hypothesis of atoms
and their affinity, in biology the theory of the molecular
structure of living protoplasm, and so forth.</p>

<p>The explanation of a great number of connected phenomena
by the assumption of a common cause is called
a <i>theory</i>. Both in theory and hypothesis &ldquo;faith&rdquo; (in
the scientific sense) is indispensable; for here again it
is the imagination that fills up the gaps left by the intelligence
in our knowledge of the connection of things.
A theory, therefore, must always be regarded only as
an approximation to the truth; it must be understood
that it may be replaced in time by another and better-grounded
theory. But, in spite of this admitted uncertainty,
theory is indispensable for all true science;
it elucidates facts by postulating a cause for them.
The man who renounces theory altogether, and seeks
to construct a pure science with certain facts alone (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
often happens with wrong-headed representatives of
our &ldquo;exact sciences&rdquo;), must give up the hope of any
knowledge of causes, and, consequently, of the satisfaction
of reason&rsquo;s demand for causality.</p>

<p>The theory of gravitation in astronomy (Newton),
the nebular theory in cosmogony (Kant and Laplace),
the principle of energy in physics (Meyer and Helmholtz),
the atomic theory in chemistry (Dalton), the
vibratory theory in optics (Huyghens), the cellular
theory in histology (Schleiden and Schwann), and the
theory of descent in biology (Lamarck and Darwin),
are all important theories of the first rank; they explain
a whole world of natural phenomena by the assumption
of a common cause for all the several facts of
their respective provinces, and by showing that all the
phenomena thereof are inter-connected and controlled
by laws which issue from this common cause. Yet the
cause itself may remain obscure in character, or be
merely a &ldquo;provisional hypothesis.&rdquo; The &ldquo;force of gravity&rdquo;
in the theory of gravitation and in cosmogony,
&ldquo;energy&rdquo; itself in its relation to matter, the &ldquo;ether&rdquo; of
optics and electricity, the &ldquo;atom&rdquo; of the chemist, the
living &ldquo;protoplasm&rdquo; of histology, the &ldquo;heredity&rdquo; of
the evolutionist&mdash;these and similar conceptions of other
great theories may be regarded by a sceptical philosophy
as &ldquo;mere hypotheses&rdquo; and the outcome of scientific
&ldquo;faith,&rdquo; yet they are indispensable for us, until
they are replaced by better hypotheses.</p>

<p>The dogmas which are used for the explanation of
phenomena in the various religions, and which go by
the name of &ldquo;faith&rdquo; (in the narrower sense), are of a
very different character from the forms of scientific
faith we have enumerated. The two types, however&mdash;the
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; faith of science and the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>&ldquo;supernatural&rdquo;
faith of religion&mdash;are not infrequently confounded,
so that we must point out their fundamental difference.
Religious faith means always belief in a miracle,
and as such is in hopeless contradiction with the
natural faith of reason. In opposition to reason it postulates
supernatural agencies, and, therefore, may be
justly called superstition. The essential difference of
this superstition from rational faith lies in the fact that
it assumes supernatural forces and phenomena, which
are unknown and inadmissible to science, and which
are the outcome of illusion and fancy; moreover, superstition
contradicts the well-known laws of nature,
and is therefore <i>irrational</i>.</p>

<p>Owing to the great progress of ethnology during the
century, we have learned a vast quantity of different
kinds and practices of superstition, as they still survive
in uncivilized races. When they are compared
with each other and with the mythological notion of
earlier ages, a manifold analogy is discovered, frequently
a common origin, and eventually one simple
source for them all. This is found in the &ldquo;demand of
causality in reason,&rdquo; in the search for an explanation
of obscure phenomena by the discovery of a cause.
That applies particularly to such phenomena as threaten
us with danger and excite fear, like thunder and
lightning, earthquakes, eclipses, etc. The demand for
a causal explanation of such phenomena is found in
uncivilized races of the lowest grade, transmitted from
their primate ancestors by heredity. It is even found
in many other vertebrates. When a dog barks at the
full moon, or at a ringing bell, of which it sees the hammer
moving, or at a flag that flutters in the breeze, it
expresses not only fear, but also the mysterious impulse
to learn the cause of the obscure phenomenon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
The crude beginnings of religion among primitive races
spring partly from this hereditary superstition of their
primate ancestors, and partly from the worship of ancestors,
from various emotional impulses, and from
habits which have become traditional.</p>

<p>The religious notions of modern civilized peoples,
which they esteem so highly, profess to be on a much
higher level than the &ldquo;crude superstition&rdquo; of the savage;
we are told of the great advance which civilization
has made in sweeping it aside. That is a great
mistake. Impartial comparison and analysis show
that they only differ in their special &ldquo;form of faith&rdquo;
and the outer shell of their creed. In the clear light of
reason the refined faith of the most liberal ecclesiastical
religion&mdash;inasmuch as it contradicts the known
and inviolable laws of nature&mdash;is no less irrational a
superstition than the crude spirit-faith of primitive
fetichism on which it looks down with proud disdain.</p>

<p>And if, from this impartial stand-point, we take a
critical glance at the kinds of faith that prevail to-day
in civilized countries, we find them everywhere saturated
with traditional superstition. The Christian belief
in Creation, the Trinity, the Immaculate Conception,
the Redemption, the Resurrection and Ascension
of Christ, and so forth, is just as purely imaginative as
the belief in the various dogmas of the Mohammedan,
Mosaic, Buddhistic, and Brahmanic religions, and is
just as incapable of reconciliation with a rational knowledge
of nature. Each of these religions is for the sincere
believer an indisputable truth, and each regards
the other as heresy and damnable error. The more
confidently a particular sect considers itself &ldquo;the only
ark of salvation,&rdquo; and the more ardently this conviction
is cherished, the more zealously does it contend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
against all other sects and give rise to the fearful religious
wars that form the saddest pages in the book of
history. And all the time the unprejudiced &ldquo;critique of
pure reason&rdquo; teaches us that all these different forms
of faith are equally false and irrational, mere creatures
of poetic fancy and uncritical tradition. Rational science
must reject them all alike as the outcome of superstition.</p>

<p>The incalculable injury which irrational superstition
has done to credulous humanity is conspicuously revealed
in the ceaseless conflict of confessions of faith.
Of all the wars which nations have waged against each
other with fire and sword the religious wars have been
the bloodiest; of all the forms of discord that have shattered
the happiness of families and of individuals those
that arise from religious differences are still the most
painful. Think of the millions who have lost their
lives in Christian persecutions, in the religious conflicts
of Islam and of the Reformation, by the Inquisition,
and under the charge of witchcraft. Or think of
the still greater number of luckless men who, through
religious differences, have been plunged into family
troubles, have lost the esteem of their fellow-citizens
and their position in the community, or have even been
compelled to fly from their country. The official confession
of faith becomes most pernicious of all when it is
associated with the political aims of a modern state, and
is enforced as &ldquo;religious instruction&rdquo; in our schools.
The child&rsquo;s mind is thus early diverted from the pursuit
of the truth and impregnated with superstition.
Every friend of humanity should do all in his power
to promote unsectarian schools as one of the most valuable
institutions of the modern state.</p>

<p>The great value which is, none the less, still very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
widely attached to sectarian instruction is not only due
to the compulsion of a reactionary state and its dependence
on a dominant clericalism, but also to the weight
of old traditions and &ldquo;emotional cravings&rdquo; of various
kinds. One of the strongest of these is the devout reverence
which is extended everywhere to sectarian tradition,
to the &ldquo;faith of our fathers.&rdquo; In thousands of
stories and poems fidelity to it is extolled as a spiritual
treasure and a sacred duty. Yet a little impartial study
of the history of faith suffices to show the absurdity of
the notion. The dominant evangelical faith of the
second half of the nineteenth century is essentially different
from that of the first half, and this again from
that of the eighteenth century. The faith of the eighteenth
century diverges considerably from the &ldquo;faith
of our fathers&rdquo; of the seventeenth, and still more from
that of the sixteenth, century. The Reformation, releasing
enslaved reason from the tyranny of the popes,
is naturally regarded by them as darkest heresy; but
even the faith of the papacy itself had been completely
transformed in the course of a century. And how different
is the faith of the Christian from that of his heathen
ancestors. Every man with some degree of independent
thought frames a more or less personal religion
for himself, which is always different from that of his
fathers; it depends largely on the general condition
of thought in his day. The further we go back in
the history of civilization, the more clearly do we find
this esteemed &ldquo;faith of our fathers&rdquo; to be an indefensible
superstition which is undergoing continual transformation.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable forms of superstition,
which still takes a very active part in modern life, is
<i>spiritism</i>. It is a surprising and a lamentable fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
that millions of educated people are still dominated by
this dreary superstition; even distinguished scientists
are entangled in it. A number of spiritualist journals
spread the faith far and wide, and our &ldquo;superior circles&rdquo;
do not scruple to hold <i>séances</i> in which &ldquo;spirits&rdquo;
appear, rapping, writing, giving messages from &ldquo;the
beyond,&rdquo; and so on. It is a frequent boast of spiritists
that even eminent men of science defend their superstition.
In Germany, A. Zöllner and Fechner are quoted
as instances; in England, Wallace and Crookes. The
regrettable circumstance that physicists and biologists
of such distinction have been led astray by spiritism
is accounted for, partly by their excess of imagination
and defect of critical faculty, and partly by the powerful
influence of dogmas which a religious education
imprinted on the brain in early youth. Moreover, it
was precisely through the famous <i>séances</i> at Leipzig,
in which the physicists, Zöllner, Fechner, and Wilhelm
Weber, were imposed on by the clever American conjuror,
Slade, that the fraud of the latter was afterwards
fully exposed; he was discovered to be a common impostor.
In other cases, too, where the alleged marvels
of spiritism have been thoroughly investigated, they
have been traced to a more or less clever deception; the
mediums (generally of the weaker sex) have been found
to be either smart swindlers or nervous persons of
abnormal irritability. Their supposed gift of &ldquo;telepathy&rdquo;
(or &ldquo;action at a distance of thought without
material medium&rdquo;) has no more existence than the
&ldquo;voices&rdquo; or the &ldquo;groans&rdquo; of spirits, etc. The vivid
pictures which Carl du Prel, of Munich, and other spiritists
give of their phenomena must be regarded as the
outcome of a lively imagination, together with a lack
of critical power and of knowledge of physiology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>The majority of religions have, in spite of their great
differences, one common feature, which is, at the same
time, one of their strongest supports in many quarters.
They declare that they can elucidate the problem of
existence, the solution of which is beyond the natural
power of reason, by the supernatural way of revelation;
from that they derive the authority of the dogmas which
in the guise of &ldquo;divine laws&rdquo; control morality and the
practical conduct of life. &ldquo;Divine&rdquo; inspirations of
that kind form the basis of many myths and legends,
the human origin of which is perfectly clear. It is
true that the God who reveals himself does not always
appear in human shape, but in thunder and lightning,
storm and earthquake, fiery bush or menacing cloud.
But the revelation which he is supposed to bring to the
credulous children of men is always anthropomorphic;
it invariably takes the form of a communication of
ideas or commands which are formulated and expressed
precisely as is done in the normal action of the human
brain and larynx. In the Indian and Egyptian religions,
in the mythologies of Greece and Rome, in the
Old and the New Testaments, the gods think, talk,
and act just as men do; the revelations, in which they
are supposed to unveil for us the secrets of existence
and the solution of the great world-enigma, are creations
of the human imagination. The &ldquo;truth&rdquo; which
the credulous discover in them is a human invention;
the &ldquo;childlike faith&rdquo; in these irrational revelations is
mere superstition.</p>

<p>The true revelation&mdash;that is, the true source of rational
knowledge&mdash;is to be sought in nature alone. The
rich heritage of truth which forms the most valuable
part of human culture is derived exclusively from the
experiences acquired in a searching study of nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
and from the rational conclusions which it has reached
by the just association of these empirical presentations.
Every intelligent man with normal brain and senses
finds this true revelation in nature on impartial study,
and thus frees himself from the superstition with which
the &ldquo;revelations&rdquo; of religion had burdened him.</p>

(<i>c</i>) The Immaculate Conception</p>

<p>One of the most distinctive features of the expiring
century is the increasing vehemence of the opposition
between science and Christianity. That is both
natural and inevitable. In the same proportion in
which the victorious progress of modern science has
surpassed all the scientific achievements of earlier ages
has the untenability been proved of those mystic views
which would subdue reason under the yoke of an alleged
revelation; and the Christian religion belongs to
that group. The more solidly modern astronomy,
physics, and chemistry have established the sole dominion
of inflexible natural laws in the universe at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
large, and modern botany, zoology, and anthropology
have proved the validity of those laws in the entire kingdom
of organic nature, so much the more strenuously
has the Christian religion, in association with dualistic
metaphysics, striven to deny the application of these
natural laws in the province of the so-called &ldquo;spiritual
life&rdquo;&mdash;that is, in one section of the physiology of the
brain.</p>

<p>No one has more clearly, boldly, and unanswerably
enunciated this open and irreconcilable opposition between
the modern scientific and the outworn Christian
view than David Friedrich Strauss, the greatest theologian
of the nineteenth century. His last work, <i>The
Old Faith and the New</i>, is a magnificent expression of
the honest conviction of all educated people of the present
day who understand this unavoidable conflict between
the discredited, dominant doctrines of Christianity
and the illuminating, rational revelation of modern
science&mdash;all those who have the courage to defend the
right of reason against the pretensions of superstition,
and who are sensible of the philosophic demand for a
unified system of thought. Strauss, as an honorable
and courageous free-thinker, has expounded far better
than I could the principal points of difference between
&ldquo;the old and the new faith.&rdquo; The absolute irreconcilability
of the opponents and the inevitability of their
struggle (&ldquo;for life or death&rdquo;) have been ably presented
on the philosophic side by E. Hartmann, in his interesting
work on <i>The Self-Destruction of Christianity</i>.</p>

<p>When the works of Strauss and Feuerbach and <i>The
History of the Conflict between Religion and Science</i> of
J. W. Draper have been read, it may seem superfluous
for us to devote a special chapter to the subject. Yet
we think it useful, and even necessary for our purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
to cast a critical glance at the historical course of this
great struggle; especially seeing that the attacks of
the &ldquo;Church militant&rdquo; on science in general, and on
the theory of evolution in particular, have become extremely
bitter and menacing of late years. Unfortunately,
the mental relaxation which has lately set in,
and the rising flood of reaction in the political, social,
and ecclesiastical world, are only too well calculated to
give point to those dangers. If any one doubts it, he
has only to look over the conduct of Christian synods
and of the German Reichstag during the last few years.
Quite in harmony are the recent efforts of many secular
governments to get on as good a footing as possible
with the &ldquo;spiritual regiment,&rdquo; their deadly enemy&mdash;that
is, to submit to its yoke. The two forces find a
common aim in the suppression of free thought and
free scientific research, for the purpose of thus more
easily securing a complete despotism.</p>

<p>Let us first emphatically protest that it is a question
for us of the necessary defence of science and reason
against the vigorous attacks of the Christian Church
and its vast army, not of an unprovoked attack of
science on religion. And, in the first place, our defence
must be prepared against Romanism or Ultramontanism.
This &ldquo;one ark of salvation,&rdquo; this Catholic Church
&ldquo;destined for all,&rdquo; is not only much larger and more
powerful than the other Christian sects, but it has the
exceptional advantage of a vast, centralized organization
and an unrivalled political ability. Men of science
are often heard to say that the Catholic superstition
is no more astute than the other forms of supernatural
faith, and that all these insidious institutions are
equally inimical to reason and science. As a matter
of general theoretical principle the statement may pass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
but it is certainly wrong when we look to its practical
side. The deliberate and indiscriminate attacks of the
ultramontane Church on science, supported by the
apathy and ignorance of the masses, are, on account
of its powerful organization, much more severe and
dangerous than those of other religions.</p>

<p>In order to appreciate correctly the extreme importance
of Christianity in regard to the entire history of
civilization, and particularly its fundamental opposition
to reason and science, we must briefly run over
the principal stages of its historical evolution. It may
be divided into four periods: (1) primitive Christianity
(the first three centuries), (2) papal Christianity (twelve
centuries, from the fourth to the fifteenth), (3) the Reformation
(three centuries, from the sixteenth to the
eighteenth), and (4) modern pseudo-Christianity.</p>

<h3>I.&mdash;PRIMITIVE CHRISTIANITY</h3>

<p>Primitive Christianity embraces the first three centuries.
Christ himself, the noble prophet and enthusiast,
so full of the love of humanity, was far below the
level of classical culture; he knew nothing beyond
the Jewish traditions; he has not left a single line of
writing. He had, indeed, no suspicion of the advanced
stage to which Greek philosophy and science had progressed
five hundred years before.</p>

<p>All that we know of him and of his original teaching
is taken from the chief documents of the New Testament&mdash;the
four gospels and the Pauline epistles. As
to the four canonical gospels, we now know that they
were selected from a host of contradictory and forged
manuscripts of the first three centuries by the three
hundred and eighteen bishops who assembled at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
Council of Nicæa in 327. The entire list of gospels
numbered forty; the canonical list contains four. As
the contending and mutually abusive bishops could
not agree about the choice, they determined to leave
the selection to a miracle. They put all the books (according
to the <i>Synodicon</i> of Pappus) together underneath
the altar, and prayed that the apocryphal books,
of human origin, might remain there, and the genuine,
inspired books might be miraculously placed on the
table of the Lord. And that, says tradition, really occurred!
The three synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark,
and Luke&mdash;all written <i>after</i> them, not <i>by</i> them, at the
beginning of the second century) and the very different
fourth gospel (ostensibly &ldquo;after&rdquo; John, written about
the middle of the second century) leaped on the table,
and were thenceforth recognized as the inspired (with
their thousand mutual contradictions) foundations of
Christian doctrine. If any modern &ldquo;unbeliever&rdquo; finds
this story of the &ldquo;leap of the sacred books&rdquo; incredible,
we must remind him that it is just as credible as the
table-turning and spirit-rapping that are believed to
take place to-day by millions of educated people; and
that hundreds of millions of Christians believe just as
implicitly in their personal immortality, their &ldquo;resurrection
from the dead,&rdquo; and the Trinity of God&mdash;dogmas
that contradict pure reason no more and no less
than that miraculous bound of the gospel manuscripts.</p>

<p>The most important sources after the gospels are the
fourteen separate (and generally forged) epistles of
Paul. The genuine Pauline epistles (<i>three</i> in number,
according to recent criticism&mdash;to the Romans, Galatians,
and Corinthians) were written before the canonical
gospels, and contain less incredible miraculous matter
than they. They are also more concerned than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
gospels to adjust themselves with a rational view of
the world. Hence the advanced theology of modern
times constructs its &ldquo;ideal Christianity&rdquo; rather on the
base of the Pauline epistles than on the gospels, so
that it has been called &ldquo;Paulinism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The remarkable personality of Paul, who possessed
much more culture and practical sense than Christ, is
extremely interesting, from the anthropological point
of view, from the fact that the racial origin of the two
great religious founders is very much the same. Recent
historical investigation teaches that Paul&rsquo;s father
was of Greek nationality, and his mother of Jewish.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
The half-breeds of these two races, which are so very
distant in origin (although they are branches of the
same species, the <i>homo mediterraneus</i>), are often distinguished
by a happy blending of talents and temperament,
as we find in many recent and actual instances.
The plastic Oriental imagination and the
critical Western reason often admirably combine and
complete each other. That is visible in the Pauline
teaching, which soon obtained a greater influence than
the earliest Christian notions. Hence it is not incorrect
to consider Paulinism a new phenomenon, of which
the father was the philosophy of the Greeks, and the
mother the religion of the Jews. Neoplatonism is an
analogous combination.</p>

<p>As to the real teaching and aims of Christ (and as
to many important aspects of his life) the views of conflicting
theologians diverge more and more, as historical
criticism (Strauss, Feuerbach, Baur, Renan, etc.)
puts the accessible facts in their true light, and draws
impartial conclusions from them. Two things, cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>tainly,
remain beyond dispute&mdash;the lofty principle of
universal charity and the fundamental maxim of ethics,
the &ldquo;golden rule,&rdquo; that issues therefrom; both, however,
existed in theory and in practice centuries before
the time of Christ (cf. <a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">chap. xix</a>.). For the rest, the
Christians of the early centuries were generally pure
Communists, sometimes &ldquo;Social Democrats,&rdquo; who, according
to the prevailing theory in Germany to-day,
ought to have been exterminated with fire and sword.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;PAPAL CHRISTIANITY</h3>

<p>Latin Christianity, variously called Papistry, Romanism,
Vaticanism, Ultramontanism, or the Roman
Catholic Church, is one of the most remarkable phenomena
in the history of civilized man; in spite of the
storms that have swept over it, it still exerts a most powerful
influence. Of the four hundred and ten million
Christians who are scattered over the earth the majority&mdash;that
is, two hundred and twenty-five millions&mdash;are
Roman Catholics; there are seventy-five million
Greek Catholics and one hundred and ten million
Protestants. During a period of one thousand two
hundred years, from the fourth to the sixteenth century,
the papacy has almost absolutely controlled and
tainted the spiritual life of Europe; on the other hand,
it has won but little territory from the ancient religions
of Asia and Africa. In Asia Buddhism still counts
five hundred and three million followers, the Brahmanic
religion one hundred and thirty-eight millions,
and Islam one hundred and twenty millions.</p>

<p>It is the despotism of the papacy that lent its darkest
character to the Middle Ages; it meant death to all
freedom of mental life, decay to all science, corruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
to all morality. From the noble height to which the
life of the human mind had attained in classical antiquity,
in the centuries before Christ and the first century
after Christ, it soon sank, under the rule of the
papacy, to a level which, in respect of the knowledge of
the truth, can only be termed barbarism. It is often
protested that other aspects of mental life&mdash;poetry and
architecture, scholastic learning and patristic philosophy&mdash;were
richly developed in the Middle Ages. But
this activity was in the service of the Church; it did
not tend to the cultivation, but to the suppression, of
free mental research. The exclusive preparing for an
unknown eternity beyond the tomb, the contempt of
nature, the withdrawal from the study of it, which are
essential elements of Christianity, were urged as a
sacred duty by the Roman hierarchy. It was not until
the beginning of the sixteenth century that a change
for the better came in with the Reformation.</p>

<p>It is impossible for us here to describe the pitiful retrogression
of culture and morality during the twelve
centuries of the spiritual despotism of Rome. It is very
pithily expressed in a saying of the greatest and the
ablest of the Hohenzollerns; Frederick the Great condensed
his judgment in the phrase that the study of history
led one to think that from Constantine to the date
of the Reformation the whole world was insane. L.
Büchner has given us an admirable, brief description
of this &ldquo;period of insanity&rdquo; in his work on <i>Religious
and Scientific Systems</i>. The reader who desires a closer
acquaintance with the subject would do well to consult
the historical works of Ranke, Draper, Kolb, Svoboda,
etc. The truthful description of the awful condition of
the Christian Middle Ages, which is given by these and
other unprejudiced historians, is confirmed by all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
reliable sources of investigation, and by the historical
monuments which have come down from the saddest
period of human history. Educated Catholics, who are
sincere truth-seekers, cannot be too frequently recommended
to study these historical sources for themselves.
This is the more necessary as ultramontane literature
has still a considerable influence. The old trick of deceiving
the faithful by a complete reversal of facts and
an invention of miraculous circumstances is still worked
by it with great success. We will only mention
Lourdes and the &ldquo;Holy Coat&rdquo; of Trêves. The ultramontane
professor of history at Frankfurt, Johannes
Janssen, affords a striking example of the length they
will go in distorting historical truth; his much-read
works (especially his <i>History of the German People
since the Middle Ages</i>) are marred by falsification to an
incredible extent. The untruthfulness of these Jesuitical
productions is on a level with the credulity and
the uncritical judgment of the simple German nation
that takes them for gospel.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting of the historical facts
which clearly prove the evil of the ultramontane despotism
is its vigorous and consistent struggle with science.
This was determined on, in principle, from the
very beginning of Christianity, inasmuch as it set faith
above reason and preached the blind subjection of the
one to the other; that was natural, seeing that our
whole life on earth was held to be only a preparation
for the legendary life beyond, and thus scientific research
was robbed of any real value. The deliberate
and successful attack on science began in the early
part of the fourth century, particularly after the Council
of Nicæa (327), presided over by Constantine&mdash;called
the &ldquo;Great&rdquo; because he raised Christianity to the po<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>sition
of a state religion, and founded Constantinople,
though a worthless character, a false-hearted hypocrite,
and a murderer. The success of the papacy in its
conflict with independent scientific thought and inquiry
is best seen in the distressing condition of science
and its literature during the Middle Ages. Not
only were the rich literary treasures that classical antiquity
had bequeathed to the world destroyed for the
most part, or withdrawn from circulation, but the rack
and the stake insured the silence of every heretic&mdash;that
is, every independent thinker. If he did not keep
his thoughts to himself, he had to look forward to being
burned alive, as was the fate of the great monistic philosopher,
Giordano Bruno, the reformer, John Huss, and
more than a hundred thousand other &ldquo;witnesses to the
truth.&rdquo; The history of science in the Middle Ages
teaches us on every page that independent thought
and empirical research were completely buried for
twelve sad centuries under the oppression of the omnipotent
papacy.</p>

<p>All that we esteem in true Christianity, in the sense
of its founder and of his noblest followers, and that we
must endeavor to save from the inevitable wreck of this
great world religion for our new monistic religion, lies
on its ethical and social planes. The principles of true
humanism, the golden rule, the spirit of tolerance, the
love of man, in the best and highest sense of the word&mdash;all
these true graces of Christianity were not, indeed,
first discovered and given to the world by that religion,
but were successfully developed in the critical period
when classical antiquity was hastening to its doom.
The papacy, however, has attempted to convert all
those virtues into the direct contrary, and still to hang
out the sign of the old firm. Instead of Christian char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>ity,
it introduced a fanatical hatred of the followers of
all other religions; with fire and sword it has pursued,
not only the heathen, but every Christian sect that
dared resist the imposition of ultramontane dogma.
Tribunals for heretics were erected all over Europe,
yielding unnumbered victims, whose torments seemed
only to fill their persecutors, with all their Christian
charity, with a peculiar satisfaction. The power of
Rome was directed mercilessly for centuries against
everything that stood in its way. Under the notorious
Torquemada (1481-98), in Spain alone eight thousand
heretics were burned alive and ninety thousand punished
with the confiscation of their goods and the
most grievous ecclesiastical fines; in the Netherlands,
under the rule of Charles V., at least fifty thousand
men fell victims to the clerical bloodthirst. And while
the heavens resounded with the cry of the martyrs, the
wealth of half the world was pouring into Rome, to
which the whole of Christianity paid tribute, and the
self-styled representatives of God on earth and their
accomplices (not infrequently Atheists themselves) wallowed
in pleasure and vice of every description. &ldquo;And
all these privileges,&rdquo; said the frivolous, syphilitic Pope,
Leo X., &ldquo;have been secured to us by the fable of Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet, with all the discipline of the Church and the
fear of God, the condition of European society was
pitiable. Feudalism, serfdom, the grace of God, and
the favor of the monks ruled the land; the poor helots
were only too glad to be permitted to raise their miserable
huts under the shadow of the castle or the cloister,
their secular and spiritual oppressors and exploiters.
Even to-day we suffer from the aftermath of these
awful ages and conditions, in which there was no ques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>tion
of care for science or higher mental culture save
in rare circumstances and in secret. Ignorance, poverty,
and superstition combined with the immoral operation
of the law of celibacy, which had been introduced
in the eleventh century, to consolidate the ever-growing
power of the papacy. It has been calculated
that there were more than ten million victims of fanatical
religious hatred during this &ldquo;Golden Age&rdquo; of
papal domination; and how many more million human
victims must be put to the account of celibacy,
oral confession, and moral constraint, the most pernicious
and accursed institutions of the papal despotism!
Unbelieving philosophers, who have collected
disproofs of the existence of God, have overlooked one
of the strongest arguments in that sense&mdash;the fact that
the Roman &ldquo;Vicar of Christ&rdquo; could for twelve centuries
perpetrate with impunity the most shameful and
horrible deeds &ldquo;in the name of God.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>III.&mdash;THE REFORMATION</h3>

<p>The history of civilization, which we are so fond of
calling &ldquo;the history of the world,&rdquo; enters upon its third
period with the Reformation of the Christian Church,
just as its second period begins with the founding of
Christianity. With the Reformation begins the new
birth of fettered reason, the reawakening of science,
which the iron hand of the Christian papacy had relentlessly
crushed for twelve hundred years. At the
same time the spread of general education had already
commenced, owing to the invention of printing about
the middle of the fifteenth century; and towards its
close several great events occurred, especially the discovery
of America in 1492, which prepared the way for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
the &ldquo;renaissance&rdquo; of science in company with that of art.
Indeed, certain very important advances were made in
the knowledge of nature during the first half of the sixteenth
century, which shook the prevailing system to
its very foundations. Such were the circumnavigation
of the globe by Magellan in 1522, which afforded
empirical proof of its rotundity, and the founding of
the new system of the world by Copernicus in 1543.</p>

<p>Yet the 31st of October in the year 1517, the day on
which Martin Luther nailed his ninety-five theses to
the wooden door of Wittenburg Cathedral, must be
regarded as the commencement of a new epoch; for
on that day was forced the iron door of the prison in
which the Papal Church had detained fettered reason
for twelve hundred years. The merits of the great reformer
have been partly exaggerated, partly underestimated.
It has been justly pointed out that Luther, like
all the other reformers, remained in manifold subjection
to the deepest superstition. Thus he was throughout
life a supporter of the rigid dogma of the verbal inspiration
of the Bible; he zealously maintained the doctrines
of the resurrection, original sin, predestination,
justification by faith, etc. He rejected as folly the
great discovery of Copernicus, because in the Bible
&ldquo;Joshua bade the sun, not the earth, stand still.&rdquo; He
utterly failed to appreciate the great political revolutions
of his time, especially the profound and just agitation
of the peasantry. Worse still was the fanatical
Calvin, of Geneva, who had the talented Spanish physician,
Serveto, burned alive in 1553, because he rejected
the absurd dogma of the Trinity. The fanatical
&ldquo;true believers&rdquo; of the reformed Church followed
only too frequently in the blood-stained footsteps of
their papal enemies; as they do even in our own day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
Deeds of unparalleled cruelty followed in the train of
the Reformation&mdash;the massacre of St. Bartholomew
and the persecution of the Huguenots in France, bloody
heretic-hunts in Italy, civil war in England, and the
Thirty Years War in Germany. Yet, in spite of those
grave blemishes, to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
belongs the honor of once more opening a free
path to the thoughtful mind, and delivering reason
from the oppressive yoke of the papacy. Thus only
was made possible that great development of different
tendencies in critical philosophy and of new paths in science
which won for the subsequent eighteenth century
the honorable title of &ldquo;the century of enlightenment.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;THE PSEUDO-CHRISTIANITY OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</h3>

<p>As the fourth and last stage in the history of Christianity
we oppose our nineteenth century to all its predecessors.
It is true that the enlightenment of preceding
centuries had promoted critical thought in every direction,
and the rise of science itself had furnished powerful
empirical weapons; yet it seems to us that our
progress along both lines has been quite phenomenal
during the nineteenth century. It has inaugurated
an entirely new period in the history of the human mind,
characterized by the development of the monistic philosophy
of nature. At its very commencement the
foundations were laid of a new anthropology (by the
comparative anatomy of Cuvier) and of a new biology
(by the <i>Philosophie Zoologique</i> of Lamarck). The two
great French scientists were quickly succeeded by two
contemporary German scholars&mdash;Baer, the founder
of the science of evolution, and Johannes Müller, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
founder of comparative morphology and physiology.
A pupil of Müller, Theodor Schwann, created the far-reaching
cellular theory in 1838, in conjunction with
M. Schleiden. Lyell had already traced the evolution
of the earth to natural causes, and thus proved the application
to our planet of the mechanical cosmogony
which Kant had sketched with so much insight in 1755.
Finally, Robert Mayer and Helmholtz established the
principle of energy in 1842&mdash;the second, complementary
half of the great law of substance, the first half
of which (the persistence of matter) had been previously
discovered by Lavoisier. Forty years ago Charles
Darwin crowned all these profound revelations of the
intimate nature of the universe by his new theory of
evolution, the greatest natural-philosophical achievement
of our century.</p>

<p>What is the relation of modern Christianity to this
vast and unparalleled progress of science? In the first
place, the deep gulf between its two great branches,
conservative Romanism and progressive Protestantism,
has naturally widened. The ultramontane clergy
(and we must associate with them the orthodox &ldquo;evangelical
alliance&rdquo;) had naturally to offer a strenuous
opposition to this rapid advance of the emancipated
mind; they continued unmoved in their rigid literal
belief, demanding the unconditional surrender of reason
to dogma. Liberal Protestantism, on the other
hand, took refuge in a kind of monistic pantheism, and
sought a means of reconciling two contradictory principles.
It endeavored to combine the unavoidable
recognition of the established laws of nature, and the
philosophic conclusions that followed from them, with
a purified form of religion, in which scarcely anything
remained of the distinctive teaching of faith. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
were many attempts at compromise to be found between
the two extremes; but the conviction rapidly spread
that dogmatic Christianity had lost every foundation,
and that only its valuable ethical contents should be
saved for the new monistic religion of the twentieth
century. As, however, the existing external forms
of the dominant Christian religion remained unaltered,
and as, in spite of a progressive political development,
they are more intimately than ever connected with the
practical needs of the State, there has arisen that widespread
religious profession in educated spheres which
we can only call &ldquo;pseudo-Christianity&rdquo;&mdash;at the bottom
it is a &ldquo;religious lie&rdquo; of the worst character. The
great dangers which attend this conflict between sincere
conviction and the hypocritical profession of modern
pseudo-Christians are admirably described in Max
Nordau&rsquo;s interesting work on <i>The Conventional Lies
of Civilization</i>.</p>

<p>In the midst of this obvious falseness of prevalent
pseudo-Christianity there is one favorable circumstance
for the progress of a rational study of nature: its most
powerful and bitterest enemy, the Roman Church,
threw off its mask of ostensible concern for higher mental
development about the middle of the nineteenth
century, and declared a <i>guerre à l&rsquo;outrance</i> against independent
science. This happened in three important
challenges to reason, for the explicitness and resoluteness
of which modern science and culture cannot but
be grateful to the &ldquo;Vicar of Christ.&rdquo; (1) In December,
1854, the pope promulgated the dogma of the immaculate
conception of Mary. (2) Ten years afterwards&mdash;in
December, 1864&mdash;the pope published, in
his famous <i>encyclica</i>, an absolute condemnation of the
whole of modern civilization and culture; in the <i>sylla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>bus</i>
that accompanied it he enumerated and anathematized
all the rational theses and philosophical principles
which are regarded by modern science as lucid
truths. (3) Finally, six years afterwards&mdash;on July
13, 1870&mdash;the militant head of the Church crowned
his folly by claiming <i>infallibility</i> for himself and all
his predecessors in the papal chair. This triumph
of the Roman <i>curia</i> was communicated to the astonished
world five days afterwards, on the very day on
which France declared war with Prussia. Two months
later the temporal power of the pope was taken from
him in consequence of the war.</p>

<p>These three stupendous acts of the papacy were such
obvious assaults on the reason of the nineteenth century
that they gave rise, from the very beginning, to
a most heated discussion even within orthodox Catholic
circles. When the Vatican Council proceeded to
define the dogma of infallibility on July 13, 1870,
only three-fourths of the bishops declared in its favor,
451 out of 601 assenting; many other bishops, who
wished to keep clear of the perilous definition, were absent
from the council. But the shrewd pontiff had
calculated better than the timid &ldquo;discreet Catholics&rdquo;:
even this extraordinary dogma was blindly accepted by
the credulous and uneducated masses of the faithful.</p>

<p>The whole history of the papacy, as it is substantiated
by a thousand reliable sources and accessible documents,
appears to the impartial student as an unscrupulous
tissue of lying and deceit, a reckless pursuit
of absolute mental despotism and secular power,
a frivolous contradiction of all the high moral precepts
which true Christianity enunciates&mdash;charity and
toleration, truth and chastity, poverty and self-denial.
When we judge the long series of popes and of the Ro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>man
princes of the Church, from whom the pope is
chosen, by the standard of pure Christian morality,
it is clear that the great majority of them were pitiful
impostors, many of them utterly worthless and vicious.
These well-known historical facts, however, do not
prevent millions of educated Catholics from admitting
the infallibility which the pope has claimed for himself;
they do not prevent Protestant princes from going to
Rome, and doing reverence to the pontiff (their most
dangerous enemy); they do not prevent the fate of the
German people from being intrusted to-day to the hands
of the servants and followers of this &ldquo;pious impostor&rdquo;
in the Reichstag&mdash;thanks to the incredible political
indolence and credulity of the nation.</p>

<p>The most interesting of the three great events by
which the papacy has endeavored to maintain and
strengthen its despotism in the nineteenth century is
the publication of the encyclica and the syllabus in
December, 1864. In these remarkable documents all
independent action was forbidden to reason and science,
and they were commanded to submit implicitly to faith&mdash;that
is, to the decrees of the infallible pope. The
great excitement which followed this sublime piece of
effrontery in educated and independent circles was in
proportion with the stupendous contents of the encyclica.
Draper has given us an excellent discussion
of its educational and political significance in his <i>History
of the Conflict between Science and Religion</i>.</p>

<p>The dogma of the immaculate conception seems,
perhaps, to be less audacious and significant than the
encyclica and the dogma of the infallibility of the pope.
Yet not only the Roman hierarchy, but even some of
the orthodox Protestants (the Evangelical Alliance,
for instance), attach great importance to this thesis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
What is known as the &ldquo;immaculate oath&rdquo;&mdash;that is,
the confirmation of faith by an oath taken on the immaculate
conception of Mary&mdash;is still regarded by millions
of Christians as a sacred obligation. Many
believers take the dogma in a twofold application;
they think that the mother of Mary was impregnated
by the Holy Ghost as well as Mary herself. Comparative
and critical theology has recently shown that this
myth has no greater claim to originality than most of
the other stories in the Christian mythology; it has
been borrowed from older religions, especially Buddhism.
Similar myths were widely circulated in India, Persia,
Asia Minor, and Greece several centuries before the
birth of Christ. Whenever a king&rsquo;s unwedded daughter,
or some other maid of high degree, gave birth to a
child, the father was always pronounced to be a god,
or a demi-god; in the Christian case it was the Holy
Ghost.</p>

<p>The special endowments of mind or body which often
distinguished these &ldquo;children of love&rdquo; above ordinary
offspring were thus partly explained by &ldquo;heredity.&rdquo;
Distinguished &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo; of this kind were held in
high esteem both in antiquity and during the Middle
Ages, while the moral code of modern civilization reproaches
them with their want of honorable parentage.
This applies even more forcibly to &ldquo;daughters of God,&rdquo;
though the poor maidens are just as little to blame for
their want of a father. For the rest, every one who is
familiar with the beautiful mythology of classical antiquity
knows that these sons and daughters of the
Greek and Roman gods often approach nearest to the
highest ideal of humanity. Recollect the large legitimate
family, and the still more numerous illegitimate
offspring, of Zeus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>To return to the particular question of the impregnation
of the Virgin Mary by the Holy Ghost, we are
referred to the gospels for testimony to the fact. The
only two evangelists who speak of it, Matthew and
Luke, relate in harmony that the Jewish maiden Mary
was betrothed to the carpenter Joseph, but became pregnant
without his co-operation, and, indeed, &ldquo;by the Holy
Ghost.&rdquo; As we have already related, the four canonical
gospels which are regarded as the only genuine ones by
the Christian Church, and adopted as the foundation of
faith, were deliberately chosen from a much larger number
of gospels, the details of which contradict each other
sometimes just as freely as the assertions of the four.
The fathers of the Church enumerate from forty to fifty
of these spurious or apocryphal gospels; some of them
are written both in Greek and Latin&mdash;for instance, the
gospel of James, of Thomas, of Nicodemus, and so
forth. The details which these apocryphal gospels
give of the life of Christ, especially with regard to his
birth and childhood, have just as much (or, on the
whole, just as little) claim to historical validity as the
four canonical gospels.</p>

<p>Now we find in one of these documents an historical
statement, confirmed, moreover, in the <i>Sepher Toldoth
Jeschua</i>, which probably furnishes the simple and natural
solution of the &ldquo;world-riddle&rdquo; of the supernatural
conception and birth of Christ. The author curtly
gives us in one sentence the remarkable statement
which contains this solution: &ldquo;Josephus Pandera, the
Roman officer of a Calabrian legion which was in
Judæa, seduced Miriam of Bethlehem, and was the
father of Jesus.&rdquo; Other details given about Miriam
(the Hebrew name for Mary) are far from being to the
credit of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>&ldquo;Queen of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Naturally, these historical details are carefully avoided
by the official theologian, but they assort badly with
the traditional myth, and lift the veil from its mystery
in a very simple and natural fashion. That makes it
the more incumbent on impartial research and pure
reason to make a critical examination of these statements.
It must be admitted that they have much more
title to credence than all the other statements about the
birth of Christ. When, on familiar principles of science,
we put aside the notion of supernatural conception
through an &ldquo;overshadowing of the Most High&rdquo; as a
pure myth, there only remains the widely accepted version
of modern rational theology&mdash;that Joseph, the
Jewish carpenter, was the true father of Christ. But
this assumption is explicitly contradicted by many
texts of the gospels; Christ himself was convinced that
he was a &ldquo;Son of God,&rdquo; and he never recognized his
foster-father, Joseph, as his real parent. Joseph, indeed,
wanted to leave his betrothed when he found her pregnant
without his interference. He gave up this idea
when an angel appeared to him in a dream and pacified
him. As it is expressly stated in the first chapter
of Matthew (vv. 24, 25), there was no sexual intercourse
between Joseph and Mary until after Jesus was born.</p>

<p>The statement of the apocryphal gospels, that the
Roman officer, Pandera, was the true father of Christ,
seems all the more credible when we make a careful
anthropological study of the personality of Christ. He
is generally regarded as purely Jewish. Yet the characteristics
which distinguish his high and noble personality,
and which give a distinct impress to his religion,
are certainly not Semitical; they are rather features of
the higher Arian race, and especially of its noblest
branch, the Hellenes. Now, the name of Christ&rsquo;s real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
father, &ldquo;Pandera,&rdquo; points unequivocally to a Greek
origin; in one manuscript, in fact, it is written &ldquo;Pandora.&rdquo;
Pandora was, according to the Greek mythology,
the first woman, born of the earth by Vulcan and
adorned with every charm by the gods, who was espoused
by Epimetheus, and sent by Zeus to men with
the dread &ldquo;Pandora-box,&rdquo; containing every evil, in
punishment for the stealing of divine fire from heaven
by Prometheus.</p>

<p>And it is interesting to see the different reception that
the love-story of Miriam has met with at the hands of
the four great Christian nations of civilized Europe.
The stern morality of the Teutonic races entirely repudiates
it; the righteous German and the prudish Briton
prefer to believe blindly in the impossible thesis of a
conception &ldquo;by the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; It is well known
that this strenuous and carefully paraded prudery of
the higher classes (especially in England) is by no
means reflected in the true condition of sexual morality
in high quarters. The revelations which the <i>Pall
Mall Gazette</i>, for instance, made on the subject twelve
years ago vividly recalled the condition of Babylon.</p>

<p>The Romantic races, which ridicule this prudery and
take sexual relations less seriously, find <i>Mary&rsquo;s Romance</i>
attractive enough; the special cult which &ldquo;Our
Lady&rdquo; enjoys in France and Italy is often associated
with this love-story with curious naïveté. Thus, for
example, Paul de Regla (Dr. Desjardin), author of <i>Jesus
of Nazareth considered from a Scientific, Historical, and
Social Standpoint</i> (1894), finds precisely in the illegitimate
birth of Christ a special &ldquo;title to the halo that irradiates
his noble form.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed to me necessary to enter fully into this important
question of the origin of Christ in the sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
impartial historical science, because the Church militant
itself lays great emphasis on it, and because it regards
the miraculous structure which has been founded
on it as one of its strongest weapons against modern
thought. The highest ethical value of pure primitive
Christianity and the ennobling influence of this &ldquo;religion
of love&rdquo; on the history of civilization are quite
independent of those mythical dogmas. The so-called
&ldquo;revelations&rdquo; on which these myths are based are incompatible
with the firmest results of modern science.</p>

OUR MONISTIC RELIGION</h2>

<p class="summary">Monism as a Connecting Link between Religion and Science&mdash;The
<i>Cultur-Kampf</i>&mdash;The Relations of Church and State&mdash;Principles
of the Monistic Religion&mdash;Its Three-fold Ideal: the
Good, the True, and the Beautiful&mdash;Contradiction between
Scientific and Christian Truth&mdash;Harmony of the Monistic
and the Christian Idea of Virtue&mdash;Opposition between Monistic
and Christian Views of Art&mdash;Modern Expansion and Enrichment
of Our Idea of the World&mdash;Landscape-Painting and the
Modern Enjoyment of Nature&mdash;The Beauties of Nature&mdash;This
World and Beyond&mdash;Monistic Churches</p>

<p>Many distinguished scientists and philosophers of
the day, who share our monistic views, consider
that religion is generally played out. Their meaning
is that the clear insight into the evolution of the
world which the great scientific progress of the nineteenth
century has afforded us will satisfy, not only
the causal feeling of our reason, but even our highest
emotional cravings. This view is correct in the sense
that the two ideas, religion and science, would indeed
blend into one if we had a perfectly clear and consecutive
system of monism. However, there are but a
few resolute thinkers who attain to this most pure and
lofty conception of Spinoza and Goethe. Most of the
educated people of our time (as distinct from the uncultured
masses) remain in the conviction that religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
is a separate branch of our mental life, independent of
science, and not less valuable and indispensable.</p>

<p>If we adopt this view, we can find a means of reconciling
the two great and apparently quite distinct branches
in the idea I put forward in &ldquo;Monism, as a Connecting-Link
between Religion and Science,&rdquo; in 1892.
In the preface to this <i>Confession of Faith of a Man of
Science</i> I expressed myself in the following words with
regard to its double object: &ldquo;In the first place, I must
give expression to the rational system which is logically
forced upon us by the recent progress of science;
it dwells in the intimate thoughts of nearly every impartial
and thoughtful scientist, though few have the
courage or the disposition to avow it. In the second
place, I would make of it a connecting-link between religion
and science, and thus do away with the antithesis
which has been needlessly maintained between
these two branches of the highest activity of the human
mind. The ethical craving of our emotion is satisfied
by monism no less than the logical demand for
causality on the part of reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The remarkable interest which the discourse enkindled
is a proof that in this monistic profession of
faith I expressed the feeling not only of many scientists,
but of a large number of cultured men and women of
very different circles. Not only was I rewarded by
hundreds of sympathetic letters, but by a wide circulation
of the printed address, of which six editions
were required within six months. I had the more reason
to be content with this unexpected success, as this
&ldquo;confession of faith&rdquo; was originally merely an occasional
speech which I delivered unprepared on October
9, 1892, at Altenburg, during the jubilee of the Scientific
Society of East Germany. Naturally there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
the usual demonstration on the other side; I was fiercely
attacked, not only by the ultramontane press, the
sworn defenders of superstition, but also by the &ldquo;liberal&rdquo;
controversialists of evangelical Christianity,
who profess to defend both scientific truth and purified
faith. In the seven years that have ensued since that
time the great struggle between modern science and
orthodox Christianity has become more threatening;
it has grown more dangerous for science in proportion
as Christianity has found support in an increasing
mental and political reaction. In some countries the
Church has made such progress that the freedom of
thought and conscience, which is guaranteed by the
laws, is in practice gravely menaced (for instance,
in Bavaria). The great historic struggle which Draper
has so admirably depicted in his <i>Conflict between
Religion and Science</i> is to-day more acute and significant
than ever. For the last twenty-seven years it has
been rightly called the &ldquo;<i>cultur-kampf</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The famous encyclica and syllabus which the militant
pope, Pius IX., sent out into the entire world in
1864 were a declaration of war on the whole of modern
science; they demanded the blind submission of reason
to the dogmas of the infallible pope. The enormity
of this crude assault on the highest treasures of
civilization even roused many indolent minds from
the slumber of belief. Together with the subsequent
promulgation of the papal infallibility (1870), the encyclica
provoked a deep wave of irritation and an energetic
repulse which held out high hopes. In the
new German empire, which had attained its indispensable
national unity by the heavy sacrifices of the
wars of 1866 and 1871, the insolent attacks of the pope
were felt to be particularly offensive. On the one hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
Germany is the cradle of the Reformation and the modern
emancipation of reason; on the other hand, it unfortunately
has in its 18,000,000 Catholics a vast host
of militant believers, who are unsurpassed by any other
civilized people in blind obedience to their chief shepherd.</p>

<p>The dangers of such a situation were clearly recognized
by the great statesman who had solved the political
&ldquo;world-riddle&rdquo; of the dismemberment of Germany,
and had led us by a marvellous statecraft to
the long-desired goal of national unity and power.
Prince Bismarck began the famous struggle with the
Vatican, which is known as the <i>cultur-kampf</i>, in 1872,
and it was conducted with equal ability and energy by
the distinguished Minister of Worship, Falk, author
of the May laws of 1873. Unfortunately, Bismarck
had to desist six years afterwards. Although the great
statesman was a remarkable judge of men and a realistic
politician of immense tact, he had underestimated
the force of three powerful obstacles&mdash;first, the unsurpassed
cunning and unscrupulous treachery of the
Roman <i>curia</i>; secondly, the correlative ingratitude
and credulity of the uneducated Catholic masses, on
which the papacy built; and, thirdly, the power of
apathy, the continuance of the irrational, simply because
it is in possession. Hence, in 1878, when the
abler Leo XIII. had ascended the pontifical throne,
the fatal &ldquo;To Canossa&rdquo; was heard once more. From
that time the newly established power of Rome grew
in strength; partly through the unscrupulous intrigues
and serpentine bends of its slippery Jesuitical politics,
partly through the false Church-politics of the German
government and the marvellous political incompetence
of the German people. We have, therefore, at the close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
of the nineteenth century to endure the pitiful spectacle
of the Catholic &ldquo;Centre&rdquo; being the most important section
of the Reichstag, and the fate of our humiliated
country depending on a papal party, which does not
constitute numerically a third part of the nation.</p>

<p>When the <i>cultur-kampf</i> began in 1872, it was justly
acclaimed by all independent thinkers as a political
renewal of the Reformation, a vigorous attempt to free
modern civilization from the yoke of papal despotism.
The whole of the Liberal press hailed Bismarck as a
&ldquo;political Luther&rdquo;&mdash;as the great hero, not only of the
national unity, but also of the rational emancipation
of Germany. Ten years afterwards, when the papacy
had proved victorious, the same &ldquo;Liberal press&rdquo; changed
its colors, and denounced the <i>cultur-kampf</i> as a great
mistake; and it does the same thing to-day. The
facts show how short is the memory of our journalists,
how defective their knowledge of history, and how poor
their philosophic education. The so-called &ldquo;Peace between
Church and State&rdquo; is never more than a suspension
of hostilities. The modern papacy, true to the despotic
principles it has followed for the last sixteen hundred
years, is determined to wield sole dominion over the
credulous souls of men; it must demand the absolute
submission of the cultured State, which, as such, defends
the rights of reason and science. True and enduring
peace there cannot be until one of the combatants
lies powerless on the ground. Either the Church
wins, and then farewell to all &ldquo;free science and free
teaching&rdquo;&mdash;then are our universities no better than
jails, and our colleges become cloistral schools; or
else the modern rational State proves victorious&mdash;then,
in the twentieth century, human culture, freedom, and
prosperity will continue their progressive development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
until they far surpass even the height of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>In order to compass these high aims, it is of the first
importance that modern science not only shatter the
false structures of superstition and sweep their ruins
from the path, but that it also erect a new abode for
human emotion on the ground it has cleared&mdash;a &ldquo;palace
of reason,&rdquo; in which, under the influence of our new
monistic views, we do reverence to the real trinity of
the nineteenth century&mdash;the trinity of &ldquo;the true, the
good, and the beautiful.&rdquo; In order to give a tangible
shape to the cult of this divine ideal, we must first of
all compare our position with the dominant forms of
Christianity, and realize the changes that are involved
in the substitution of the one for the other. For, in
spite of its errors and defects, the Christian religion
(in its primitive and purer form) has so high an ethical
value, and has entered so deeply into the most important
social and political movements of civilized history
for the last fifteen hundred years, that we must
appeal as much as possible to its existing institutions
in the establishment of our monistic religion. We do
not seek a mighty <i>revolution</i>, but a rational <i>reformation</i>,
of our religious life. And just as, two thousand
years ago, the classic poetry of the ancient Greeks
incarnated their ideals of virtue in divine shapes, so
may we, too, lend the character of noble goddesses to
our three rational ideals. We must inquire into the
features of the three goddesses of the monist&mdash;truth,
beauty, and virtue; and we must study their relation
to the three corresponding ideals of Christianity which
they are to replace.</p>

<p>I. The preceding inquiries (especially those of the
first and third sections) have convinced us that truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
unadulterated is only to be found in the temple of the
study of nature, and that the only available paths to
it are critical observation and reflection&mdash;the empirical
investigation of facts and the rational study of their
efficient causes. In this way we arrive, by means of
pure reason, at true science, the highest treasure of
civilized man. We must, in accordance with the arguments
of our <a href="#CHAPTER_XVI">sixteenth chapter</a>, reject what is called
&ldquo;revelation,&rdquo; the poetry of faith, that affirms the discovery
of truth in a supernatural fashion, without the
assistance of reason. And since the entire structure
of the Judæo-Christian religion, like that of the Mohammedan
and the Buddhistic, rests on these so-called
revelations, and these mystic fruits of the imagination
directly contradict the clear results of empirical research,
it is obvious that we shall only attain to a
knowledge of the truth by the rational activity of genuine
science, not by the poetic imagining of a mystic
faith. In this respect it is quite certain that the Christian
system must give way to the monistic. The goddess
of truth dwells in the temple of nature, in the green
woods, on the blue sea, and on the snowy summits of
the hills&mdash;not in the gloom of the cloister, nor in the narrow
prisons of our jail-like schools, nor in the clouds
of incense of the Christian churches. The paths which
lead to the noble divinity of truth and knowledge are
the loving study of nature and its laws, the observation
of the infinitely great star-world with the aid of
the telescope, and the infinitely tiny cell-world with the
aid of the microscope&mdash;not senseless ceremonies and
unthinking prayers, not alms and Peter&rsquo;s Pence. The
rich gifts which the goddess of truth bestows on us are
the noble fruits of the tree of knowledge and the inestimable
treasure of a clear, unified view of the world&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>not
belief in supernatural miracles and the illusion of
an eternal life.</p>

<p>II. It is otherwise with the divine ideal of eternal
goodness. In our search for the truth we have entirely
to exclude the &ldquo;revelation&rdquo; of the churches, and devote
ourselves solely to the study of nature; but, on the
other hand, the idea of the good, which we call virtue,
in our monistic religion coincides for the most part
with the Christian idea of virtue. We are speaking,
naturally, of the primitive and pure Christianity of the
first three centuries, as far as we learn its moral teaching
from the gospels and the epistles of Paul; it does
not apply to the Vatican caricature of that pure doctrine
which has dominated European civilization, to its
infinite prejudice, for twelve hundred years. The best
part of Christian morality, to which we firmly adhere,
is represented by the humanist precepts of charity and
toleration, compassion and assistance. However, these
noble commands, which are set down as &ldquo;Christian&rdquo;
morality (in its best sense), are by no means original
discoveries of Christianity; they are derived from earlier
religions. The Golden Rule, which sums up these precepts
in one sentence, is centuries older than Christianity.
In the conduct of life this law of natural morality
has been followed just as frequently by non-Christians
and atheists as it has been neglected by pious
believers. Moreover, Christian ethics was marred by
the great defect of a narrow insistence on altruism and
a denunciation of egoism. Our monistic ethics lays
equal emphasis on the two, and finds perfect virtue in
the just balance of love of self and love of one&rsquo;s neighbor
(cf. <a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">chap. xix</a>.).</p>

<p>III. But monism enters into its strongest opposition
to Christianity on the question of beauty. Primi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>tive
Christianity preached the worthlessness of earthly
life, regarding it merely as a preparation for an eternal
life beyond. Hence it immediately followed that
all we find in the life of man here below, all that is beautiful
in art and science, in public and in private life,
is of no real value. The true Christian must avert
his eyes from them; he must think only of a worthy
preparation for the life beyond. Contempt of nature,
aversion from all its inexhaustible charms, rejection
of every kind of fine art, are Christian duties; and
they are carried out to perfection when a man separates
himself from his fellows, chastises his body, and
spends all his time in prayer in the cloister or the hermit&rsquo;s
cell.</p>

<p>History teaches us that this ascetical morality that
would scorn the whole of nature had, as a natural consequence,
the very opposite effect to that it intended.
Monasteries, the homes of chastity and discipline,
soon became dens of the wildest orgies; the sexual
commerce of monks and nuns has inspired shoals of
novels, as it is so faithfully depicted in the literature
of the Renaissance. The cult of the &ldquo;beautiful,&rdquo; which
was then practised, was in flagrant contradiction with
the vaunted &ldquo;abandonment of the world&rdquo;; and the
same must be said of the pomp and luxury which soon
developed in the immoral private lives of the higher
ecclesiastics and in the artistic decoration of Christian
churches and monasteries.</p>

<p>It may be objected that our view is refuted by the
splendor of Christian art, which, especially in the best
days of the Middle Ages, created works of undying
beauty. The graceful Gothic cathedrals and Byzantine
basilicas, the hundreds of magnificent chapels,
the thousands of marble statues of saints and martyrs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
the millions of fine pictures of saints, of profoundly
conceived representations of Christ and the madonna&mdash;all
are proofs of the development of a noble art in the
Middle Ages, which is unique of its kind. All these
splendid monuments of mediæval art are untouched
in their high æsthetic value, whatever we say of their
mixture of truth and fancy. Yes; but what has all
that to do with the pure teaching of Christianity&mdash;with
that religion of sacrifice that turned scornfully away
from all earthly parade and glamour, from all material
beauty and art; that made light of the life of the family
and the love of woman; that urged an exclusive concern
as to the immaterial goods of eternal life? The
idea of a Christian art is a contradiction in terms&mdash;a
<i>contradictio in adjecto</i>. The wealthy princes of the
Church who fostered it were candidly aiming at very
different ideals, and they completely attained them.
In directing the whole interest and activity of the human
mind in the Middle Ages to the Christian Church
and its distinctive art they were diverting it <i>from nature</i>
and from the knowledge of the treasures that were hidden
in it, and would have conducted to independent
science. Moreover, the daily sight of the huge images
of the saints and of the scenes of &ldquo;sacred history&rdquo; continually
reminded the faithful of the vast collection
of myths that the Church had made. The legends
themselves were taught and believed to be true narratives,
and the stories of miracles to be records of actual
events. It cannot be doubted that in this respect
Christian art has exercised an immense influence on
general culture, and especially in the strengthening
of Christian belief&mdash;an influence which still endures
throughout the entire civilized world.</p>

<p>The diametrical opposite of this dominant Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
art is the new artistic tendency which has been developed
during the present century in connection with
science. The remarkable expansion of our knowledge
of nature, and the discovery of countless beautiful
forms of life, which it includes, have awakened quite
a new æsthetic sense in our generation, and thus given
a new tone to painting and sculpture. Numerous scientific
voyages and expeditions for the exploration
of unknown lands and seas, partly in earlier centuries,
but more especially in the nineteenth, have brought to
light an undreamed abundance of new organic forms.
The number of new species of animals and plants soon
became enormous, and among them (especially among
the lower groups that had been neglected before) there
were thousands of forms of great beauty and interest,
affording an entirely new inspiration for painting, sculpture,
architecture, and technical art. In this respect a
new world was revealed by the great advance of microscopic
research in the second half of the century, and
especially by the discovery of the marvellous inhabitants
of the deep sea, which were first brought to light
by the famous expedition of the <i>Challenger</i> (1872-76).
Thousands of graceful radiolaria and thalamophora,
of pretty medusæ and corals, of extraordinary molluscs,
and crabs, suddenly introduced us to a wealth
of hidden organisms beyond all anticipation, the peculiar
beauty and diversity of which far transcend all
the creations of the human imagination. In the fifty
large volumes of the account of the <i>Challenger</i> expedition
a vast number of these beautiful forms are
delineated on three thousand plates; and there are
millions of other lovely organisms described in other
great works that are included in the fast-growing literature
of zoology and botany of the last ten years. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
began on a small scale to select a number of these
beautiful forms for more popular description in my
<i>Art Forms in Nature</i> (1899).</p>

<p>However, there is now no need for long voyages and
costly works to appreciate the beauties of this world.
A man needs only to keep his eyes open and his mind
disciplined. Surrounding nature offers us everywhere
a marvellous wealth of lovely and interesting objects
of all kinds. In every bit of moss and blade of grass,
in every beetle and butterfly, we find, when we examine
it carefully, beauties which are usually overlooked.
Above all, when we examine them with a powerful glass
or, better still, with a good microscope, we find everywhere
in nature a new world of inexhaustible charms.</p>

<p>But the nineteenth century has not only opened our
eyes to the æsthetic enjoyment of the microscopic world;
it has shown us the beauty of the greater objects in
nature. Even at its commencement it was the fashion
to regard the mountains as magnificent but forbidding,
and the sea as sublime but dreaded. At its close the
majority of educated people&mdash;especially they who dwell
in the great cities&mdash;are delighted to enjoy the glories
of the Alps and the crystal splendor of the glacier world
for a fortnight every year, or to drink in the majesty of
the ocean and the lovely scenery of its coasts. All these
sources of the keenest enjoyment of nature have only
recently been revealed to us in all their splendor, and
the remarkable progress we have made in facility and
rapidity of conveyance has given even the less wealthy
an opportunity of approaching them. All this progress
in the æsthetic enjoyment of nature&mdash;and, proportionately,
in the scientific understanding of nature&mdash;implies
an equal advance in higher mental development and,
consequently, in the direction of our monistic religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>The opposite character of our <i>naturalistic</i> century to
that of the <i>anthropistic</i> centuries that preceded is especially
noticeable in the different appreciation and
spread of illustrations of the most diverse natural objects.
In our own days a lively interest in artistic
work of that kind has been developed, which did not
exist in earlier ages; it has been supported by the remarkable
progress of commerce and technical art which
have facilitated a wide popularization of such illustrations.
Countless illustrated periodicals convey along
with their general information a sense of the inexhaustible
beauty of nature in all its departments. In particular,
landscape-painting has acquired an importance
that surpassed all imagination. In the first half of the
century one of our greatest and most erudite scientists,
Alexander Humboldt, had pointed out that the development
of modern landscape-painting is not only of
great importance as an incentive to the study of nature
and as a means of geographical description, but that
it is to be commended in other respects as a noble educative
medium. Since that time the taste for it has
considerably increased. It should be the aim at every
school to teach the children to enjoy scenery at an early
age, and to give them the valuable art of imprinting
on the memory by a drawing or water-color sketch.</p>

<p>The infinite wealth of nature in what is beautiful
and sublime offers every man with open eyes and an
æsthetic sense an incalculable sum of choicest gifts.
Still, however valuable and agreeable is the immediate
enjoyment of each single gift, its worth is doubled by a
knowledge of its meaning and its connection with the
rest of nature. When Humboldt gave us the &ldquo;outline
of a physical description of the world&rdquo; in his magnificent
<i>Cosmos</i> forty years ago, and when he combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
scientific and æsthetic consideration so happily in his
standard <i>Prospects of Nature</i>, he justly indicated how
closely the higher enjoyment of nature is connected
with the &ldquo;scientific establishment of cosmic laws,&rdquo; and
that the conjunction of the two serves to raise human
nature to a higher stage of perfection. The astonishment
with which we gaze upon the starry heavens and
the microscopic life in a drop of water, the awe with
which we trace the marvellous working of energy in
the motion of matter, the reverence with which we
grasp the universal dominance of the law of substance
throughout the universe&mdash;all these are part of our
emotional life, falling under the heading of &ldquo;natural
religion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This progress of modern times in knowledge of the
true and enjoyment of the beautiful expresses, on the
one hand, a valuable element of our monistic religion,
but is, on the other hand, in fatal opposition to Christianity.
For the human mind is thus made to live on
this side of the grave; Christianity would have it ever
gaze beyond. Monism teaches that we are perishable
children of the earth, who for one or two, or, at the
most, three generations, have the good fortune to enjoy
the treasures of our planet, to drink of the inexhaustible
fountain of its beauty, and to trace out the marvellous
play of its forces. Christianity would teach us
that the earth is &ldquo;a vale of tears,&rdquo; in which we have
but a brief period to chasten and torment ourselves in
order to merit the life of eternal bliss beyond. Where
this &ldquo;beyond&rdquo; is, and of what joys the glory of this
eternal life is compacted, no revelation has ever told
us. As long as &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; was thought to be the blue
vault that hovers over the disk of our planet, and is illumined
by the twinkling light of a few thousand stars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
the human imagination could picture to itself the ambrosial
banquets of the Olympic gods above or the laden
tables of the happy dwellers in Valhalla. But now all
these deities and the immortal souls that sat at their
tables are &ldquo;houseless and homeless,&rdquo; as David Strauss
has so ably described; for we know from astrophysical
science that the immeasurable depths of space are filled
with a prosaic ether, and that millions of heavenly
bodies, ruled by eternal laws of iron, rush hither and
thither in the great ocean, in their eternal rhythm of
life and death.</p>

<p>The places of devotion, in which men seek the
satisfaction of their religious emotions and worship
the objects of their reverence, are regarded as sacred
&ldquo;churches.&rdquo; The pagodas of Buddhistic Asia, the
Greek temples of classical antiquity, the synagogues
of Palestine, the mosques of Egypt, the Catholic cathedrals
of the south, and the Protestant cathedrals of the
north, of Europe&mdash;all these &ldquo;houses of God&rdquo; serve to
raise man above the misery and the prose of daily life,
to lift him into the sacred, poetic atmosphere of a higher,
ideal world. They attain this end in a thousand
different ways, according to their various forms of worship
and their age. The modern man who &ldquo;has science
and art&rdquo;&mdash;and, therefore, &ldquo;religion&rdquo;&mdash;needs no
special church, no narrow, enclosed portion of space.
For through the length and breadth of free nature,
wherever he turns his gaze, to the whole universe or
to any single part of it, he finds, indeed, the grim &ldquo;struggle
for life,&rdquo; but by its side are ever &ldquo;the good, the true,
and the beautiful&rdquo;; his church is commensurate with
the whole of glorious nature. Still, there will always
be men of special temperament who will desire to have
decorated temples or churches as places of devotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
to which they may withdraw. Just as the Catholics
had to relinquish a number of churches to the Reformation
in the sixteenth century, so a still larger number
will pass over to &ldquo;free societies&rdquo; of monists in the coming
years.</p>

OUR MONISTIC ETHICS</h2>

<p class="summary">Monistic and Dualistic Ethics&mdash;Contradiction of Pure and Practical
Reason in Kant&mdash;His Categorical Imperative&mdash;The Neo-Kantians&mdash;Herbert
Spencer&mdash;Egoism and Altruism&mdash;Equivalence
of the Two Instincts&mdash;The Fundamental Law of Ethics:

School Reform</p>

<p>The practical conduct of life makes a number of
definite ethical claims on a man which can only
be duly and naturally satisfied when they are in complete
harmony with his view of the world. In accordance
with this fundamental principle of our monistic
philosophy, our whole system of ethics must be rationally
connected with the unified conception of the cosmos
which we have formed by our advanced knowledge
of the laws of nature. Just as the infinite universe
is one great whole in the light of our monistic
teaching, so the spiritual and moral life of man is a part
of this cosmos, and our naturalistic ordering of it must
also be monistic. There are not two different, separate
worlds&mdash;the one physical and material, and the other
moral and immaterial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>The great majority of philosophers and theologians
still hold the contrary opinion. They affirm, with
Kant, that the moral world is quite independent of
the physical, and is subject to very different laws; hence
a man&rsquo;s conscience, as the basis of his moral life, must
also be quite independent of our scientific knowledge
of the world, and must be based rather on his religious
faith. On that theory the study of the moral world
belongs to <i>practical</i> reason, while that of nature, or of
the physical world, is referred to <i>pure</i> or theoretical
reason. This unequivocal and conscious dualism of
Kant&rsquo;s philosophy was its greatest defect; it has caused,
and still causes, incalculable mischief. First of all
the &ldquo;critical Kant&rdquo; had built up the splendid and marvellous
palace of pure reason, and convincingly proved
that the three great central dogmas of metaphysics&mdash;a
personal God, free will, and the immortal soul&mdash;had
no place whatever in it, and that no rational proof could
be found of their reality. Afterwards, however, the
&ldquo;dogmatic Kant&rdquo; superimposed on this true crystal
palace of <i>pure</i> reason the glittering, ideal castle in the
air of <i>practical</i> reason, in which three imposing church-naves
were designed for the accommodation of those
three great mystic divinities. When they had been
put out at the front door by rational knowledge they
returned by the back door under the guidance of
irrational faith.</p>

<p>The cupola of his great cathedral of faith was crowned
by Kant with his curious idol, the famous &ldquo;categorical
imperative.&rdquo; According to it, the demand of the universal
moral law is unconditional, independent of any
regard to actuality or potentiality. It runs: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>&ldquo;Act at
all times in such wise that the maxim (or the subjective
law of thy will) may hold good as a principle of a universal
law.&rdquo; On that theory all normal men would have
the same sense of duty. Modern anthropology has
ruthlessly dissipated that pretty dream; it has shown
that conceptions of duty differ even more among uncivilized
than among civilized nations. All the actions
and customs which we regard as sins or loathsome
crimes (theft, fraud, murder, adultery, etc.) are considered
by other nations in certain circumstances to
be virtues, or even sacred duties.</p>

<p>Although the obvious contradiction of the two forms
of reason in Kant&rsquo;s teaching, the fundamental antagonism
of pure and practical reason, was recognized
and attacked at the very beginning of the century, it
is still pretty widely accepted. The modern school
of neo-Kantians urges a &ldquo;return to Kant&rdquo; so pressingly
precisely on account of this agreeable dualism;
the Church militant zealously supports it because it
fits in admirably with its own mystic faith. But it
met with an effective reverse at the hands of modern
science in the second half of the nineteenth century,
which entirely demolished the theses of the system of
practical reason. Monistic cosmology proved, on the
basis of the law of substance, that there is no personal
God; comparative and genetic psychology showed
that there cannot be an immortal soul; and monistic
physiology proved the futility of the assumption of
&ldquo;free will.&rdquo; Finally, the science of evolution made
it clear that the same eternal iron laws that rule in the
inorganic world are valid too in the organic and moral
world.</p>

<p>But modern science gives not only a negative support
to practical philosophy and ethics in demolishing
the Kantian dualism, but it renders the positive service
of substituting for it the new structure of ethical mon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>ism.
It shows that the feeling of duty does not rest
on an illusory &ldquo;categorical imperative,&rdquo; but on the
solid ground of <i>social instinct</i>, as we find in the case
of all social animals. It regards as the highest aim of
all morality the re-establishment of a sound harmony
between egoism and altruism, between self-love and
the love of one&rsquo;s neighbor. It is to the great English
philosopher, Herbert Spencer, that we owe the founding
of this monistic ethics on a basis of evolution.</p>

<p>Man belongs to the social vertebrates, and has, therefore,
like all social animals, two sets of duties&mdash;first
to himself, and secondly to the society to which he belongs.
The former are the behests of self-love or egoism,
the latter of love for one&rsquo;s fellows or altruism. The
two sets of precepts are equally just, equally natural,
and equally indispensable. If a man desire to have
the advantage of living in an organized community,
he has to consult not only his own fortune, but also
that of the society, and of the &ldquo;neighbors&rdquo; who form
the society. He must realize that its prosperity is his
own prosperity, and that it cannot suffer without his
own injury. This fundamental law of society is so
simple and so inevitable that one cannot understand
how it can be contradicted in theory or in practice; yet
that is done to-day, and has been done for thousands
of years.</p>

<p>The equal appreciation of these two natural impulses,
or the moral equivalence of self-love and love of others,
is the chief and the fundamental principle of our morality.
Hence the highest aim of all ethics is very
simple&mdash;it is the re-establishment of &ldquo;the natural equality
of egoism and altruism, of the love of one&rsquo;s self and
the love of one&rsquo;s neighbor.&rdquo; The Golden Rule says:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>&ldquo;Do unto others as you would that they should do unto
you.&rdquo; From this highest precept of Christianity it
follows of itself that we have just as sacred duties towards
ourselves as we have towards our fellows. I have
explained my conception of this principle in my <i>Monism</i>,
and laid down three important theses. (1) Both
these concurrent impulses are natural laws, of equal
importance and necessity for the preservation of the
family and the society; egoism secures the self-preservation
of the individual, altruism that of the species
which is made up of the chain of perishable individuals.
(2) The social duties which are imposed by the
social structure of the associated individuals, and by
means of which it secures its preservation, are merely
higher evolutionary stages of the social instincts, which
we find in all higher social animals (as &ldquo;habits which
have become hereditary&rdquo;). (3) In the case of civilized
man all ethics, theoretical or practical, being &ldquo;a science
of rules,&rdquo; is connected with his view of the world
at large, and consequently with his religion.</p>

<p>From the recognition of the fundamental principle
of our morality we may immediately deduce its highest
precept, that noble command, which is often called
the Golden Rule of morals, or, briefly, the Golden Rule.
Christ repeatedly expressed it in the simple phrase:
&ldquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&rdquo; Mark
adds that &ldquo;there is no greater commandment than this,&rdquo;
and Matthew says: &ldquo;In these two commandments
is the whole law and the prophets.&rdquo; In this greatest
and highest commandment our monistic ethics is completely
at one with Christianity. We must, however,
recall the historical fact that the formulation of this
supreme command is not an original merit of Christ,
as the majority of Christian theologians affirm and
their uncritical supporters blindly accept. The Gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>en
Rule is five hundred years older than Christ; it
was laid down as the highest moral principle by many
Greek and Oriental sages. Pittacus, of Mylene, one
of the seven wise men of Greece, said six hundred and
twenty years before Christ: &ldquo;Do not that to thy neighbor
that thou wouldst not suffer from him.&rdquo; Confucius,
the great Chinese philosopher and religious founder
(who rejected the idea of a personal God and of the
immortality of the soul), said five hundred years <span class="small">B.C.</span>:
&ldquo;Do to every man as thou wouldst have him do to thee;
and do not to another what thou wouldst not have him
do to thee. This precept only dost thou need; it is
the foundation of all other commandments.&rdquo; Aristotle
taught about the middle of the fourth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>:
&ldquo;We must act towards others as we wish others to act
towards us.&rdquo; In the same sense, and partly in the
same words, the Golden Rule was given by Thales,
Isocrates, Aristippus, Sextus, the Pythagorean, and
other philosophers of classic antiquity&mdash;several centuries
before Christ. From this collection it is clear
that the Golden Rule had a <i>polyphyletic</i> origin&mdash;that
is, it was formulated by a number of philosophers at
different times and in different places, quite independently
of each other. Otherwise it must be assumed
that Jesus derived it from some other Oriental source,
from ancient Semitic, Indian, Chinese, or especially
Buddhistic traditions, as has been proved in the case
of most of the other Christian doctrines.</p>

<p>As the great ethical principle is thus twenty-five hundred
years old, and as Christianity itself has put it at
the head of its moral teaching as the highest and all-embracing
commandment, it follows that our monistic
ethics is in complete harmony on this important point,
not only with the ethics of the ancient heathens, but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
with that of Christianity. Unfortunately this harmony
is disturbed by the fact that the gospels and the Pauline
epistles contain many other points of moral teaching,
which contradict our first and supreme commandment.
Christian theologians have fruitlessly striven
to explain away these striking and painful contradictions
by their ingenious interpretations. We need not
enter into that question now, but we must briefly consider
those unfortunate aspects of Christian ethics
which are incompatible with the better thought of the
modern age, and which are distinctly injurious in their
practical consequences. Of that character is the contempt
which Christianity has shown for self, for the
body, for nature, for civilization, for the family, and
for woman.</p>

<p>I. The supreme mistake of Christian ethics, and
one which runs directly counter to the Golden Rule,
is its exaggeration of love of one&rsquo;s neighbor at the expense
of self-love. Christianity attacks and despises
egoism on principle. Yet that natural impulse is absolutely
indispensable in view of self-preservation;
indeed, one may say that even altruism, its apparent
opposite, is only an enlightened egoism. Nothing
great or elevated has ever taken place without egoism,
and without the passion that urges us to great sacrifices.
It is only the excesses of the impulse that are
injurious. One of the Christian precepts that were
impressed upon us in our early youth as of great importance,
and that are glorified in millions of sermons, is:
&ldquo;Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do
good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
despitefully use you and persecute you.&rdquo; It is a very
ideal precept, but as useless in practice as it is unnatural.
So it is with the counsel, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>&ldquo;If any man will take
away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.&rdquo; Translated
into the terms of modern life, that means: &ldquo;When
some unscrupulous scoundrel has defrauded thee of
half thy goods, let him have the other half also.&rdquo; Or,
again, in the language of modern politics: &ldquo;When
the pious English take from you simple Germans one
after another of your new and valuable colonies in
Africa, let them have all the rest of your colonies also&mdash;or,
best of all, give them Germany itself.&rdquo; And,
while we touch on the marvellous world-politics of
modern England, we may note in passing its direct
contradiction of every precept of Christian charity,
which is more frequently on the lips of that great nation
than of any other nation in the world. However, the
glaring contradiction between the theoretical, <i>ideal</i>,
altruistic morality of the human individual and the
<i>real</i>, purely selfish morality of the human community,
and especially of the civilized Christian state, is a familiar
fact. It would be interesting to determine mathematically
in what proportion among organized men
the altruistic ethical ideal of the individual changes
into its contrary, the purely egoistic &ldquo;real politics&rdquo;
of the state and the nation.</p>

<p>II. Since the Christian faith takes a wholly dualistic
view of the human organism and attributes to the
immortal soul only a temporary sojourn in the mortal
frame, it very naturally sets a much greater value on
the soul than on the body. Hence results that neglect
of the care of the body, of training, and of cleanliness
which contrasts the life of the Christian Middle Ages
so unfavorably with that of pagan classical antiquity.
Christian ethics contains none of those firm commands
as to daily ablutions which are theoretically laid down
and practically fulfilled in the Mohammedan, Hindoo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
and other religions. In many monasteries the ideal of
the pious Christian is the man who does not wash and
clothe himself properly, who never changes his malodorous
gown, and who, instead of regular work, fills
up his useless life with mechanical prayers, senseless
fasts, and so forth. As a special outgrowth of this
contempt of the body we have the disgusting discipline
of the flagellants and other ascetics.</p>

<p>III. One source of countless theoretical errors and
practical blemishes, of deplorable crudity and privation,
is found in the false anthropism of Christianity&mdash;that
is, in the unique position which it gives to man, as the
image of God, in opposition to all the rest of nature. In
this way it has contributed, not only to an extremely
injurious isolation from our glorious mother &ldquo;nature,&rdquo;
but also to a regrettable contempt of all other organisms.
Christianity has no place for that well-known
love of animals, that sympathy with the nearly related
and friendly mammals (dogs, horses, cattle, etc.),
which is urged in the ethical teaching of many of the
older religions, especially Buddhism. Whoever has
spent much time in the south of Europe must have
often witnessed those frightful sufferings of animals
which fill us friends of animals with the deepest sympathy
and indignation. And when one expostulates
with these brutal &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; on their cruelty, the
only answer is, with a laugh: &ldquo;But the beasts are not
Christians.&rdquo; Unfortunately Descartes gave some support
to the error in teaching that man only has a sensitive
soul, not the animal.</p>

<p>How much more elevated is our monistic ethics than
the Christian in this regard! Darwinism teaches us
that we have descended immediately from the primates,
and, in a secondary degree, from a long series of earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
mammals, and that, therefore, they are &ldquo;our brothers&rdquo;;
physiology informs us that they have the same nerves
and sense-organs as we, and the same feelings of pleasure
and pain. No sympathetic monistic scientist
would ever be guilty of that brutal treatment of animals
which comes so lightly to the Christian in his
anthropistic illusion&mdash;to the &ldquo;child of the God of love.&rdquo;
Moreover, this Christian contempt of nature on principle
deprives man of an abundance of the highest
earthly joys, especially of the keen, ennobling enjoyment
of nature.</p>

<p>IV. Since, according to Christ&rsquo;s teaching, our planet
is &ldquo;a vale of tears,&rdquo; and our earthly life is valueless
and a mere preparation for a better life to come, it has
succeeded in inducing men to sacrifice all happiness
on this side of eternity and make light of all earthly
goods. Among these &ldquo;earthly goods,&rdquo; in the case of
the modern civilized man, we must include the countless
great and small conveniences of technical science,
hygiene, commerce, etc., which have made modern life
cheerful and comfortable; we must include all the gratifications
of painting, sculpture, music, and poetry,
which flourished exceedingly even during the Middle
Ages (in spite of its principles), and which we esteem
as &ldquo;ideal pleasures&rdquo;; we must include all that invaluable
progress of science, especially the study of nature,
of which the nineteenth century is justly proud. All
these &ldquo;earthly goods,&rdquo; that have so high a value in the
eyes of the monist, are worthless&mdash;nay, injurious&mdash;for
the most part, according to Christian teaching; the
stern code of Christian morals should look just as unfavorably
on the pursuit of these pleasures as our humanistic
ethics fosters and encourages it. Once more,
therefore, Christianity is found to be an enemy to civili<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>zation,
and the struggle which modern thought and
science are compelled to conduct with it is, in this additional
sense, a &ldquo;<i>cultur-kampf</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>V. Another of the most deplorable aspects of Christian
morality is its belittlement of the life of the family,
of that natural living together with our next of kin
which is just as necessary in the case of man as in the
case of all the higher social animals. The family is
justly regarded as the &ldquo;foundation of society,&rdquo; and the
healthy life of the family is a necessary condition of
the prosperity of the State. Christ, however, was of a
very different opinion: with his gaze ever directed to
&ldquo;the beyond,&rdquo; he thought as lightly of woman and the
family as of all other goods of &ldquo;this life.&rdquo; Of his infrequent
contact with his parents and sisters the gospels
have very little to say; but they are far from representing
his relations with his mother to have been so
tender and intimate as they are poetically depicted in
so many thousands of pictures. He was not married
himself. Sexual love, the first foundation of the family
union, seems to have been regarded by Jesus as a
necessary evil. His most enthusiastic apostle, Paul,
went still farther in the same direction, declaring it to
be better not to marry than to marry: &ldquo;It is good for
a man not to touch a woman.&rdquo; If humanity were
to follow this excellent counsel, it would soon be rid
of all earthly misery and suffering: it would be killed
off by such a &ldquo;radical cure&rdquo; within half a century.</p>

<p>VI. As Christ never knew the love of woman, he
had no personal acquaintance with that refining of
man&rsquo;s true nature that comes only from the intimate
life of man with woman. The intimate sexual union,
on which the preservation of the human race depends,
is just as important on that account as the spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
penetration of the two sexes, or the mutual complement
which they bring to each other in the practical
wants of daily life as well as in the highest ideal functions
of the soul. For man and woman are two different
organisms, equal in worth, each having its characteristic
virtues and defects. As civilization advanced,
this ideal value of sexual love was more appreciated,
and woman held in higher honor, especially among the
Teutonic races; she is the inspiring source of the highest
achievements of art and poetry. But Christ was as
far from this view as nearly the whole of antiquity;
he shared the idea that prevailed everywhere in the
East&mdash;that woman is subordinate to man, and intercourse
with her is &ldquo;unclean.&rdquo; Long-suffering nature
has taken a fearful revenge for this blunder; its sad
consequences are written in letters of blood in the history
of the papal Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The marvellous hierarchy of the Roman Church, that
never disdained any means of strengthening its spiritual
despotism, found an exceptionally powerful instrument
in the manipulation of this &ldquo;unclean&rdquo; idea, and
in the promotion of the ascetic notion that abstinence
from intercourse with women is a virtue of itself. In the
first few centuries after Christ a number of priests voluntarily
abstained from marriage, and the supposed
value of this celibacy soon rose to such a degree that
it was made obligatory. In the Middle Ages the seduction
of women of good repute and of their daughters by
Catholic priests (the confessional was an active agency
in the business) was a public scandal: many communities,
in order to prevent such things, pressed for a
license of concubinage to be given to the clergy.
And it was done in many, and sometimes very romantic,
ways. Thus, for instance, the canon law that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
the priest&rsquo;s cook should not be less than forty years old
was very cleverly &ldquo;explained&rdquo; in the sense that the
priest might have two cooks, one in the presbytery,
another without; if one was twenty-four and the other
eighteen, that made forty-two together&mdash;two years
above the prescribed age. At the Christian councils,
at which heretics were burned alive, the cardinals and
bishops sat down with whole troops of prostitutes.
The private and public debauchery of the Catholic
clergy was so scandalous and dangerous to the commonwealth
that there was a general rebellion against
it before the time of Luther, and a loud demand for a
&ldquo;reformation of the church in head and members.&rdquo; It
is well known that these immoral relations still continue
in Roman Catholic lands, although more in
secret. Formerly proposals were made from time to
time for the definitive abrogation of celibacy, as was
done, for instance, in the chambers of Baden, Bavaria,
Hesse, Saxony, and other lands; but they have,
unfortunately, hitherto proved unavailing. In the
German Reichstag, in which the ultramontane Centre
is now proposing the most ridiculous measures for the
suppression of sexual immorality, there is now no
party that will urge the abolition of celibacy in the interest
of public morality. The so-called &ldquo;Freethought&rdquo;
Party and the utopian social democracy coquette with
the favor of the Centre.</p>

<p>The modern state that would lift not only the material,
but the moral, life of its people to a higher level
is entitled, and indeed bound, to sweep away such
unworthy and harmful conditions. The obligatory
celibacy of the Catholic clergy is as pernicious and
immoral as the practice of auricular confession or
the sale of indulgences. All three have nothing what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>ever
to do with primitive Christianity. All three are
directly opposed to true Christian morality. All three
are disreputable inventions of the papacy, designed
for the sole purpose of strengthening its despotic rule
over the credulous masses and making as much
material profit as possible out of them.</p>

<p>The Nemesis of history will sooner or later exact a
terrible account of the Roman papacy, and the millions
who have been robbed of their happiness by this degenerate
religion will help to give it its death-blow in
the coming twentieth century&mdash;at least, in every truly
civilized state. It has been recently calculated that
the number of men who lost their lives in the papal
persecutions of heretics, the Inquisition, the Christian
religious wars, etc., is much more than ten millions.
But what is this in comparison with the tenfold greater
number of the unfortunate <i>moral</i> victims of the institutions
and the priestly domination of the degenerate
Christian Church&mdash;with the unnumbered millions
whose higher mental life was extinguished, whose conscience
was tortured, whose family life was destroyed,
by the Church? We may with truth apply the words
of Goethe in his <i>Bride of Corinth</i>:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Victims fall, nor lambs nor bulls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But human victims numberless.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the great <i>cultur-kampf</i>, which must go on as long
as these sad conditions exist, the first aim must be the
absolute separation of Church and State. There shall
be &ldquo;a free Church in a free State&rdquo;&mdash;that is, every Church
shall be free in the practice of its special worship and
ceremonies, and in the construction of its fantastic
poetry and superstitious dogmas&mdash;with the sole condition
that they contain no danger to social order or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
morality. Then there will be equal rights for all. Free
societies and monistic religious bodies shall be equally
tolerated, and just as free in their movements as Liberal
Protestant and orthodox ultramontane congregations.
But for all these &ldquo;faithful&rdquo; of the most diverse
sects religion will have to be a private concern. The
state shall supervise them, and prevent excesses; but
it must neither oppress nor support them. Above all,
the ratepayers shall not be compelled to contribute to
the support and spread of a &ldquo;faith&rdquo; which they honestly
believe to be a harmful superstition. In the United
States such a complete separation of Church and State
has been long accomplished, greatly to the satisfaction
of all parties. They have also the equally important
separation of the Church from the school; that is,
undoubtedly, a powerful element in the great advance
which science and culture have recently made in
America.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that this exclusion of the
Church from the school only refers to its sectarian
principles, the particular form of belief which each
Church has evolved in the course of its life. This sectarian
education is purely a private concern, and
should be left to parents and tutors, or to such priests or
teachers as may have the personal confidence of the
parents. Instead of the rejected sectarian instruction,
two important branches of education will be introduced&mdash;monistic
or humanist ethics and comparative religion.
During the last thirty years an extensive literature
has appeared dealing with the new system of ethics
which has been raised on the basis of modern science&mdash;especially
evolutionary science. Comparative religion
will be a natural companion to the actual elementary
instruction in &ldquo;biblical history&rdquo; and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
mythology of Greece and Rome. Both of these will
remain in the curriculum. The reason for that is obvious
enough; the whole of our painting and sculpture,
the chief branches of monistic æsthetics, are intimately
blended with the Christian, Greek, and Roman
mythologies. There will only be this important difference&mdash;that
the Christian myths and legends will
not be taught as truths, but as poetic fancies, like the
Greek and Roman myths; the high value of the ethical
and æsthetical material they contain will not be lessened,
but increased, by this means. As regards the
Bible, the &ldquo;book of books&rdquo; will only be given to the
children in carefully selected extracts (a sort of &ldquo;school
Bible&rdquo;); in this way we shall avoid the besmirching
of the child&rsquo;s imagination with the unclean stories
and passages which are so numerous in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Once the modern State has freed itself and its schools
from the fetters of the Church, it will be able to devote
more attention to the improvement of education.
The incalculable value of a good system of education
has forced itself more and more upon us as the many
aspects of modern civilized life have been enlarged and
enriched in the course of the century. But the development
of the educational methods has by no means
kept pace with life in general. The necessity for a
comprehensive reform of our schools is making itself
felt more and more. On this question, too, a number
of valuable works have appeared in the course of the
last forty years. We shall restrict ourselves to making
a few general observations which we think of special
importance.</p>

<p>1. In all education up to the present time <i>man</i> has
played the chief part, and especially the grammatical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
study of his language; the study of <i>nature</i> was entirely
neglected.</p>

<p>2. In the school of the future nature will be the chief
object of the study; a man shall learn a correct view of
the world he lives in; he will not be made to stand outside
of and opposed to nature, but be represented as its
highest and noblest product.</p>

<p>3. The study of the classical tongues (Latin and
Greek), which has hitherto absorbed most of the pupils&rsquo;
time and energy, is indeed valuable; but it will
be much restricted, and confined to the mere elements
(obligatory for Latin, optional for Greek).</p>

<p>4. In consequence, modern languages must be all the
more cultivated in all the higher schools (English and
French to be obligatory, Italian optional).</p>

<p>5. Historical instruction must pay more attention to
the inner mental and spiritual life of a nation, and to
the development of its civilization, and less to its external
history (the vicissitudes of dynasties, wars, and
so forth).</p>

<p>6. The elements of evolutionary science must be
learned in conjunction with cosmology, geology must
go with geography, and anthropology with biology.</p>

<p>7. The first principles of biology must be familiar to
every educated man; the modern training in observation
furnishes an attractive introduction to the biological
sciences (anthropology, zoology, and botany). A
start must be made with descriptive system (in conjunction
with ætiology or bionomy); the elements of
anatomy and physiology to be added later on.</p>

<p>8. The first principles of physics and chemistry must
also be taught, and their exact establishment with the
aid of mathematics.</p>

<p>9. Every pupil must be taught to draw well, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
from nature; and, wherever it is possible, the use of
water-colors. The execution of drawings and of water-color
sketches from nature (of flowers, animals, landscapes,
clouds, etc.) not only excites interest in nature
and helps memory to enjoy objects, but it gives the
pupil his first lesson in <i>seeing</i> correctly and understanding
what he has seen.</p>

<p>10. Much more care and time must be devoted than
has been done hitherto to corporal exercise, to gymnastics
and swimming; but it is especially important to
have walks in common every week, and journeys on
foot during the holidays. The lesson in observation
which they obtain in this way is invaluable.</p>

<p>The chief aim of higher education up to the present
time, in most countries, has been a preparation for the
subsequent profession, and the acquisition of a certain
amount of information and direction for civic duties.
The school of the twentieth century will have for its
main object the formation of independent thought, the
clear understanding of the knowledge acquired, and
an insight into the natural connection of phenomena.
If the modern state gives every citizen a vote, it should
also give him the means of developing his reason by a
proper education, in order to make a rational use of
his vote for the commonweal.</p>

<p>At the close of our philosophic study of the riddles
of the universe we turn with confidence to the
answer to the momentous question, How nearly have
we approached to a solution of them? What is the
value of the immense progress which the passing nineteenth
century has made in the knowledge of nature?
And what prospect does it open out to us for the future,
for the further development of our system in the twentieth
century, at the threshold of which we pause?
Every unprejudiced thinker who impartially considers
the solid progress of our empirical science, and the
unity and clearness of our philosophic interpretation
of it, will share our view: the nineteenth century has
made greater progress in knowledge of the world and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
in grasp of its nature than all its predecessors; it has
solved many great problems that seemed insoluble a
hundred years ago; it has opened out to us new provinces
of learning, the very existence of which was unsuspected
at the beginning of the century. Above all,
it has put clearly before our eyes the lofty aim of monistic
cosmology, and has pointed out the path which
alone will lead us towards it&mdash;the way of the exact empirical
investigation of facts, and of the critical genetic
study of their causes. The great abstract law of mechanical
causality, of which our cosmological law&mdash;the
law of substance&mdash;is but another and a concrete
expression, now rules the entire universe, as it does the
mind of man; it is the steady, immovable pole-star,
whose clear light falls on our path through the dark
labyrinth of the countless separate phenomena. To
see the truth of this more clearly, let us cast a brief
glance at the astonishing progress which the chief
branches of science have made in this remarkable
period.</p>

<h3>I.&mdash;PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY</h3>

<p>The study of the heavens is the oldest, the study of
man the youngest, of the sciences. With regard to
himself and the character of his being man only obtained
a clear knowledge in the second half of the present
century; with regard to the starry heavens, the motions
of the planets, and so on, he had acquired astonishing
information forty-five hundred years ago. The
ancient Chinese, Hindoos, Egyptians, and Chaldæans
in the distant East knew more of the science of the
spheres than the majority of educated Christians did in
the West four thousand years after them. An eclipse
of the sun was astronomically observed in China in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
year 2697 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and the plane of the ecliptic was determined
by means of a gnome eleven hundred years <span class="small">B.C.</span>,
while Christ himself had no knowledge whatever of astronomy&mdash;indeed,
he looked out upon heaven and earth,
nature and man, from the very narrowest geocentric
and anthropocentric point of view. The greatest advance
of astronomy is generally, and rightly, said to be
the founding of the heliocentric system of Copernicus,
whose famous work, <i>De Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium</i>,
of itself caused a profound revolution in the minds
of thoughtful men. In overthrowing the Ptolemaic
system, he destroyed the foundation of the Christian
theory, which regarded the earth as the centre of the
universe and man as the godlike ruler of the earth.
It was natural, therefore, that the Christian clergy,
with the pope at its head, should enter upon a fierce
struggle with the invaluable discovery of Copernicus.
Yet it soon cleared a path for itself, when Kepler and
Galileo grounded on it their true &ldquo;mechanics of the
heavens,&rdquo; and Newton gave it a solid foundation by
his theory of gravitation (1686).</p>

<p>A further great advance, comprehending the entire
universe, was the application of the idea of evolution
to astronomy. It was done by the youthful Kant in
1755; in his famous general natural history and theory
of the heavens he undertook the discussion, not only
of the &ldquo;constitution,&rdquo; but also of the &ldquo;mechanical origin&rdquo;
of the whole world-structure on Newtonian principles.
The splendid <i>Système du Monde</i> of Laplace,
who had independently come to the same conclusions
as Kant on the world-problem, gave so firm a basis to
this new <i>Mécanique Céleste</i> in 1796 that it looked as
if nothing entirely new of equal importance was left
to be discovered in the nineteenth century. Yet here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
again it had the honor of opening out entirely new
paths and infinitely enlarging our outlook on the universe.
The invention of photography and photometry,
and especially of spectral analysis (in 1860 by
Bunsen and Kirchoff), introduced physics and chemistry
into astronomy and led to cosmological conclusions
of the utmost importance. It was now made
perfectly clear that matter is the same throughout the
universe, and that its physical and chemical properties
in the most distant stars do not differ from those of the
earth under our feet.</p>

<p>The monistic conviction, which we thus arrived at,
of the physical and chemical unity of the entire cosmos
is certainly one of the most valuable general truths
which we owe to astrophysics, the new branch of astronomy
which is honorably associated with the name
of Friedrich Zöllner. Not less important is the clear
knowledge we have obtained that the same laws of
mechanical development that we have on the earth rule
throughout the infinite universe. A vast, all-embracing
metamorphosis goes on continuously in all parts of
the universe, just as it is found in the geological history
of the earth; it can be traced in the evolution of
its living inhabitants as surely as in the history of peoples
or in the life of each human individual. In one
part of space we perceive, with the aid of our best telescopes,
vast nebulæ of glowing, infinitely attenuated
gas; we see in them the embryos of heavenly bodies,
billions of miles away, in the first stage of their development.
In some of these &ldquo;stellar embryos&rdquo; the
chemical elements do not seem to be differentiated yet,
but still buried in the homogeneous primitive matter
(<i>prothyl</i>) at an enormous temperature (calculated to run
into millions of degrees); it is possible that the origi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>nal
basic &ldquo;substance&rdquo; (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page_229">p. 229</a>) is not yet divided
into ponderable and imponderable matter. In other
parts of space we find stars that have cooled down into
glowing fluid, and yet others that are cold and rigid;
we can tell their stage of evolution approximately by
their color. We find stars that are surrounded with
rings and moons like Saturn; and we recognize in the
luminous ring of the nebula the embryo of a new moon,
which has detached itself from the mother-planet, just
as the planet was released from the sun.</p>

<p>Many of the stars, the light of which has taken thousands
of years to reach us, are certainly suns like our
own mother-sun, and are girt about with planets and
moons, just as in our own solar system. We are justified
in supposing that thousands of these planets are in a
similar stage of development to that of our earth&mdash;that
is, they have arrived at a period when the temperature
at the surface lies between the freezing and boiling
point of water, and so permits the existence of water
in its liquid condition. That makes it possible that
carbon has entered into the same complex combinations
on those planets as it has done on our earth, and that
from its nitrogenous compounds protoplasm has been
evolved&mdash;that wonderful substance which alone, as far
as our knowledge goes, is the possessor of organic life.
The monera (for instance, chromacea and bacteria),
which consist only of this primitive protoplasm, and
which arise by spontaneous generation from these inorganic
nitrocarbonates, may thus have entered upon
the same course of evolution on many other planets as
on our own; first of all, living cells of the simplest
character would be formed from their homogeneous
protoplasmic body by the separation of an inner nucleus
from the outer cell body (cytostoma). Further,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
the analogy that we find in the life of all cells&mdash;whether
plasmodomous plant-cells or plasmophagous animal-cells&mdash;justifies
the inference that the further course of
organic evolution on these other planets has been
analogous to that of our own earth&mdash;always, of course,
given the same limits of temperature which permit water
in a liquid form. In the glowing liquid bodies of the
stars, where water can only exist in the form of steam,
and on the cold extinct suns, where it can only be in the
shape of ice, such organic life as we know is impossible.</p>

<p>The similarity of phylogeny, or the analogy of organic
evolution, which we may thus assume in many
stars which are at the same stage of biogenetic development,
naturally opens out a wide field of brilliant
speculation to the constructive imagination. A favorite
subject for such speculation has long been the question
whether there are men, or living beings like ourselves,
perhaps much more highly developed, in other
planets? Among the many works which have sought
to answer the question, those of Camille Flammarion,
the Parisian astronomer, have recently been extremely
popular; they are equally distinguished by exuberant
imagination and brilliant style, and by a deplorable
lack of critical judgment and biological knowledge.
We may condense in the following thesis the present
condition of our knowledge on the subject:</p>

<p>I. It is very probable that a similar biogenetic process
to that of our own earth is taking place on some of
the other planets of our solar system (Mars and Venus),
and on many planets of other solar systems; first simple
monera are formed by spontaneous generation, and
from these arise unicellular protists (first plasmodomous
primitive plants, and then plasmophagous primitive
animals).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>II. It is very probable that from these unicellular
protists arise, in the further course of evolution, first
social cell-communities (c&oelig;nobia), and subsequently
tissue-forming plants and animals (metaphyta and
metazoa).</p>

<p>III. It is also very probable that thallophyta (algæ
and fungi) were the first to appear in the plant-kingdom,
then diaphyta (mosses and ferns), finally anthophyta
(gymnosperm and angiosperm flowering plants).</p>

<p>IV. It is equally probable that the biogenetic process
took a similar course in the animal kingdom&mdash;that
from the blastæads (catallacta) first gastræads
were formed, and from these lower animal forms (c&oelig;lenteria)
higher organisms (c&oelig;lomaria) were afterwards
evolved.</p>

<p>V. On the other hand, it is very questionable whether
the different stems of these higher animals (and
those of the higher plants as well) run through the
same course of development on other planets as on our
earth.</p>

<p>VI. In particular, it is wholly uncertain whether
there are vertebrates on other planets, and whether,
in the course of their phyletic development, taking
millions of years, mammals are formed as on earth,
reaching their highest point in the formation of man;
in such an event, millions of changes would have to
be just the same in both cases.</p>

<p>VII. It is much more probable, on the contrary, that
other planets have produced other types of the higher
plants and animals, which are unknown on our earth;
perhaps from some higher animal stem, which is superior
to the vertebrate in formation, higher beings
have arisen who far transcend us earthly men in
intelligence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>VIII. The possibility of our ever entering into direct
communication with such inhabitants of other
planets seems to be excluded by the immense distance
of our earth from the other heavenly bodies, and the
absence of the requisite atmosphere in the intervening
space, which contains only ether.</p>

<p>But while many of the stars are probably in a similar
stage of biogenetic development to that of our earth
(for the last one hundred million years at least), others
have advanced far beyond this stage, and, in their planetary
old age, are hastening towards their end&mdash;the
same end that inevitably awaits our own globe. The
radiation of heat into space gradually lowers the temperature
until all the water is turned into ice; that
is the end of all organic life. The substance of the
rotating mass contracts more and more; the rapidity
of its motion gradually falls off. The orbits of the
planets and of their moons grow narrower. At length
the moons fall upon the planets, and the planets are
drawn into the sun that gave them birth. The collision
again produces an enormous quantity of heat.
The pulverized mass of the colliding bodies is distributed
freely through infinite space, and the eternal
drama of sun-birth begins afresh.</p>

<p>The sublime picture which modern astrophysics
thus unveils before the mind&rsquo;s eye shows us an eternal
birth and death of countless heavenly bodies, a periodic
change from one to the other of the different cosmogenetic
conditions, which we observe side by side
in the universe. While the embryo of a new world is
being formed from a nebula in one corner of the vast
stage of the universe, another has already condensed
into a rotating sphere of liquid fire in some far distant
spot; a third has already cast off rings at its equator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
which round themselves into planets; a fourth has become
a vast sun whose planets have formed a secondary
retinue of moons, and so on. And between them
are floating about in space myriads of smaller bodies,
meteorites, or shooting-stars, which cross and recross
the paths of the planets apparently like lawless vagabonds,
and of which a great number fall onto the planets
every day. Thus there is a continuous but slow
change in the velocities and the orbits of the revolving
spheres. The frozen moons fall onto the planets,
the planets onto their suns. Two distant suns, perhaps
already stark and cold, rush together with inconceivable
force and melt away into nebulous clouds.
And such prodigious heat is generated by the collision
that the nebula is once more raised to incandescence,
and the old drama begins again. Yet in this &ldquo;perpetual
motion&rdquo; the infinite substance of the universe,
the sum total of its matter and energy, remains eternally
unchanged, and we have an eternal repetition
in infinite time of the periodic dance of the worlds, the
metamorphosis of the cosmos that ever returns to its
starting-point. Over all rules the law of substance.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;PROGRESS OF GEOLOGY</h3>

<p>The earth and its origin were much later than the
heavens in becoming the object of scientific investigation.
The numerous ancient and modern cosmogonies
do, indeed, profess to give us as good an insight into
the origin of the earth as into that of the heavens; but
the mythological raiment, in which all alike are clothed,
betrays their origin in poetic fancy. Among the countless
legends of creation which we find in the history of
religions and of thought there is one that soon took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
precedence of all the rest&mdash;the Mosaic story of creation
as told in the first book of the Hexateuch. It did not
exist in its present form until long after the death of
Moses (probably not until eight hundred years afterwards);
but its sources are much older, and are to be
found for the most part in Assyrian, Babylonian, and
Hindoo legends. This Hebrew legend of creation obtained
its great influence through its adoption into the
Christian faith and its consecration as the &ldquo;Word of
God.&rdquo; Greek philosophers had already, five hundred
years before Christ, explained the natural origin of the
earth in the same way as that of other cosmic bodies.
Xenophanes of Colophon had even recognized the true
character of the fossils which were afterwards to prove
of such moment; the great painter, Leonardo da Vinci,
of the fifteenth century, also explained the fossils as
the petrified remains of animals which had lived in
earlier periods of the earth&rsquo;s history. But the authority
of the Bible, especially the myth of the deluge, prevented
any further progress in this direction, and insured
the triumph of the Mosaic legend until about the
middle of the last century. It survives even at the
present day among orthodox theologians. However,
in the second half of the eighteenth century, scientific
inquiry into the structure of the crust of the earth set
to work independently of the Mosaic story, and it soon
led to certain conclusions as to the origin of the earth.
The founder of geology, Werner of Freiberg, thought
that all the rocks were formed in water, while Voigt
and Hutton (1788) rightly contended that only the
stratified, fossil-bearing rocks had had an aquatic origin,
and that the Vulcanic or Plutonic mountain ranges
had been formed by the cooling down of molten matter.</p>

<p>The heated conflict of these &ldquo;Neptunian&rdquo; and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>&ldquo;Plutonic&rdquo;
schools was still going on during the first three
decades of the present century; it was only settled when
Karl Hoff (1822) established the principle of &ldquo;actualism,&rdquo;
and Sir Charles Lyell applied it with signal success
to the entire natural evolution of the earth. The
<i>Principles of Geology</i> of Lyell (1830) secured the full
recognition of the supremely important theory of continuity
in the formation of the earth&rsquo;s crust, as opposed
to the catastrophic theory of Cuvier.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Palæontology,
which had been founded by Cuvier&rsquo;s work on fossil
bones (1812), was of the greatest service to geology;
by the middle of the present century it had advanced
so far that the chief periods in the history of the earth
and its inhabitants could be established. The comparatively
thin crust of the earth was now recognized
with certainty to be the hard surface formed by the
cooling of an incandescent fluid planet, which still continues
its slow, unbroken course of refrigeration and
condensation. The crumpling of the stiffened crust,
&ldquo;the reaction of the molten fiery contents on the cool
surface,&rdquo; and especially the unceasing geological action
of water, are the natural causes which are daily
at work in the secular formation of the crust of the
earth and its mountains.</p>

<p>To the brilliant progress of modern geology we owe
three extremely important results of general import. In
the first place, it has excluded from the story of the
earth all questions of miracle, all questions of supernatural
agencies, in the building of the mountains and
the shaping of the continents. In the second place,
our idea of the length of the vast period of time which
had been absorbed in their formation has been consid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>erably
enlarged. We now know that the huge mountains
of the palæozoic, mesozoic, and cenozoic formations
have taken, not thousands, but millions of years
in their growth. In the third place, we now know that
all the countless fossils that are found in those formations
are not &ldquo;sports of nature,&rdquo; as was believed one
hundred and fifty years ago, but the petrified remains
of organisms that lived in earlier periods of the earth&rsquo;s
history, and arose by gradual transformation from a
long series of ancestors.</p>

<h3>III.&mdash;PROGRESS OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY</h3>

<p>The many important discoveries which these fundamental
sciences have made during the nineteenth century
are so well known, and their practical application
in every branch of modern life is so obvious, that we
need not discuss them in detail here. In particular,
the application of steam and electricity has given to
our nineteenth century its characteristic &ldquo;machinist-stamp.&rdquo;
But the colossal progress of inorganic and
organic chemistry is not less important. All branches
of modern civilization&mdash;medicine and technology, industry
and agriculture, mining and forestry, land and
water transport&mdash;have been so much improved in the
course of the century, especially in the second half,
that our ancestors of the eighteenth century would find
themselves in a new world, could they return. But
more valuable and important still is the great theoretical
expansion of our knowledge of nature, which we
owe to the establishment of the law of substance. Once
Lavoisier (1789) had established the law of the persistence
of matter, and Dalton (1808) had founded his new
atomic theory with its assistance, a way was open to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
modern chemistry along which it has advanced with a
rapidity and success beyond all anticipation. The
same must be said of physics in respect of the law of
the conservation of energy. Its discovery by Robert
Mayer (1842) and Hermann Helmholtz (1847) inaugurated
for this science also a new epoch of the most fruitful
development; for it put physics in a position to
grasp the universal unity of the forces of nature and
the eternal play of natural processes, in which one
force may be converted into another at any moment.</p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;PROGRESS OF BIOLOGY</h3>

<p>The great discoveries which astronomy and geology
have made during the nineteenth century, and which
are of extreme importance to our whole system, are,
nevertheless, far surpassed by those of biology. Indeed,
we may say that the greater part of the many
branches which this comprehensive science of organic
life has recently produced have seen the light in the
course of the present century. As we saw in the first
section, during the century all branches of anatomy
and physiology, botany and zoology, ontogeny and phylogeny,
have been so marvellously enriched by countless
discoveries that the present condition of biological
science is immeasurably superior to its condition a
hundred years ago. That applies first of all <i>quantitatively</i>
to the colossal growth of our positive information
in all those provinces and their several parts. But
it applies with even greater force <i>qualitatively</i> to the
deepening of our comprehension of biological phenomena,
and our knowledge of their efficient causes. In
this Charles Darwin (1859) takes the palm of victory;
by his theory of selection he has solved the great prob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>lem
of &ldquo;organic creation,&rdquo; of the natural origin of the
countless forms of life by gradual transformation.
It is true that Lamarck had recognized fifty years
earlier that the mode of this transformation lay in the
reciprocal action of heredity and adaptation. However,
Lamarck was hampered by his lack of the principle
of selection, and of that deeper insight into the true
nature of organization which was only rendered possible
after the founding of the theory of evolution and
the cellular theory. When we collated the results of
these and other disciplines, and found the key to their
harmonious interpretation in the ancestral development
of living beings, we succeeded in establishing the monistic
biology, the principles of which I have endeavored
to lay down securely in my <i>General Morphology</i>.</p>

<h3>V.&mdash;PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY</h3>

<p>In a certain sense, the true science of man, rational
anthropology, takes precedence of every other science.
The saying of the ancient sage, &ldquo;Man, know thyself,&rdquo;
and that other famous maxim, &ldquo;Man is the measure
of all things,&rdquo; have been accepted and applied from all
time. And yet this science&mdash;taking it in its widest sense&mdash;has
languished longer than all other sciences in the
fetters of tradition and superstition. We saw in the
first section how slowly and how late the science of
the human organism was developed. One of its chief
branches&mdash;embryology&mdash;was not firmly established
until 1828 (by Baer), and another, of equal importance&mdash;the
cellular theory&mdash;until 1838 (by Schwann). And
it was even later still when the answer was given to the
&ldquo;question of all questions,&rdquo; the great riddle of the
origin of man. Although Lamarck had pointed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
the only path to a correct solution of it in 1809, and
had affirmed the descent of man from the ape, it fell to
Darwin to establish the affirmation securely fifty years
afterwards, and to Huxley to collect the most important
proofs of it in 1863, in his <i>Place of Man in Nature</i>.
I have myself made the first attempt, in my <i>Anthropogeny</i>
(1874), to present in their historical connection
the entire series of ancestors through which our race
has been slowly evolved from the animal kingdom in
the course of many millions of years.</p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION</a></h2>

<p>The number of world-riddles has been continually
diminishing in the course of the nineteenth century
through the aforesaid progress of a true knowledge of
nature. Only one comprehensive riddle of the universe
now remains&mdash;the problem of substance. What is
the real character of this mighty world-wonder that
the realistic scientist calls Nature or the Universe, the
idealist philosopher calls Substance or the Cosmos,
the pious believer calls Creator or God? Can we affirm
to-day that the marvellous progress of modern cosmology
has solved this &ldquo;problem of substance,&rdquo; or at least
that it has brought us nearer to the solution?</p>

<p>The answer to this final question naturally varies considerably
according to the stand-point of the philosophic
inquirer and his empirical acquaintance with the real
world. We grant at once that the innermost character
of nature is just as little understood by us as it was by
Anaximander and Empedocles twenty-four hundred
years ago, by Spinoza and Newton two hundred years
ago, and by Kant and Goethe one hundred years ago.
We must even grant that this essence of substance becomes
more mysterious and enigmatic the deeper we
penetrate into the knowledge of its attributes, matter
and energy, and the more thoroughly we study its
countless phenomenal forms and their evolution. We
do not know the &ldquo;thing in itself&rdquo; that lies behind these
knowable phenomena. But why trouble about this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
enigmatic &ldquo;thing in itself&rdquo; when we have no means
of investigating it, when we do not even clearly know
whether it exists or not? Let us, then, leave the fruitless
brooding over this ideal phantom to the &ldquo;pure
metaphysician,&rdquo; and let us instead, as &ldquo;real physicists,&rdquo;
rejoice in the immense progress which has been
actually made by our monistic philosophy of nature.</p>

<p>Towering above all the achievements and discoveries
of the century we have the great, comprehensive
&ldquo;law of substance,&rdquo; the fundamental law of the constancy
of matter and force. The fact that substance
is everywhere subject to eternal movement and transformation
gives it the character also of the universal
law of evolution. As this supreme law has been firmly
established, and all others are subordinate to it, we
arrive at a conviction of the universal unity of nature
and the eternal validity of its laws. From the gloomy
<i>problem</i> of substance we have evolved the clear <i>law</i>
of substance. The monism of the cosmos which we
establish thereon proclaims the absolute dominion of
&ldquo;the great eternal iron laws&rdquo; throughout the universe.
It thus shatters, at the same time, the three central
dogmas of the dualistic philosophy&mdash;the personality
of God, the immortality of the soul, and the freedom
of the will.</p>

<p>Many of us certainly view with sharp regret, or even
with a profound sorrow, the death of the gods that were
so much to our parents and ancestors. We must console
ourselves in the words of the poet:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The times are changed, old systems fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And new life o&rsquo;er their ruins dawns.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The older view of idealistic dualism is breaking up
with all its mystic and anthropistic dogmas; but upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
the vast field of ruins rises, majestic and brilliant, the
new sun of our realistic monism, which reveals to us
the wonderful temple of nature in all its beauty. In
the sincere cult of &ldquo;the true, the good, and the beautiful,&rdquo;
which is the heart of our new monistic religion,
we find ample compensation for the anthropistic ideals
of &ldquo;God, freedom, and immortality&rdquo; which we have
lost.</p>

<p>Throughout this discussion of the riddles of the universe
I have clearly defined my consistent monistic
position and its opposition to the still prevalent dualistic
theory. In this I am supported by the agreement
of nearly all modern scientists who have the courage
to accept a rounded philosophical system. I must not,
however, take leave of my readers without pointing
out in a conciliatory way that this strenuous opposition
may be toned down to a certain degree on clear and
logical reflection&mdash;may, indeed, even be converted
into a friendly harmony. In a thoroughly logical
mind, applying the highest principles with equal force
in the entire field of the cosmos&mdash;in both organic and
inorganic nature&mdash;the antithetical positions of theism
and pantheism, vitalism and mechanism, approach
until they touch each other. Unfortunately, consecutive
thought is a rare phenomenon in nature. The
great majority of philosophers are content to grasp
with the right hand the pure knowledge that is built
on experience, but they will not part with the mystic
faith based on revelation, to which they cling with the
left. The best type of this contradictory dualism is
the conflict of pure and practical reason in the critical
philosophy of the most famous of modern thinkers,
Immanuel Kant.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the number is always small of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
the thinkers who will boldly reject dualism and embrace
pure monism. That is equally true of consistent
idealists and theists, and of logical realists and
pantheists. However, the reconciliation of these apparent
antitheses, and, consequently, the advance
towards the solution of the fundamental riddle of the
universe, is brought nearer to us every year in the ever-increasing
growth of our knowledge of nature. We
may, therefore, express a hope that the approaching
twentieth century will complete the task of resolving
the antitheses, and, by the construction of a system
of pure monism, spread far and wide the long-desired
unity of world-conception. Germany&rsquo;s greatest thinker
and poet, whose one hundred and fiftieth anniversary
will soon be upon us&mdash;Wolfgang Goethe&mdash;gave
this &ldquo;philosophy of unity&rdquo; a perfect poetic expression,
at the very beginning of the century, in his immortal
poems, <i>Faust</i>, <i>Prometheus</i>, and <i>God and the World</i>:</p>
